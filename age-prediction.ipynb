I found out I have about 20 tests on Tuesday because my teachers are evil...but oh well. We had marching yesterday. It was cool. We stayed inside the whole time, and I got to play second part, so the music part will be really easy. I left early from marching at around 5:00, then went out to dinner with my friends (I made the plans before I knew about marching). So, dinner was fun. It was Kelly's birthday, so it was cool. Then we went to Kel's for a sleepover, and did bunches of neat stuff, and I went to sleep earlier than usual for a sleepover since I had to be at a Bar Mitzvah this morning. It was pretty neat. I have to do this project for CR, and we have to go to two different places of worship than our own. So, one is obviously a Jewish synagogue, and I think I'm going to go to a mosque for my other one, but who knows...so, this has been my only chance to write, and I actually have to go now, so I'll write more later...maybe.  *Ya di amore*\"], '20,November,2002': ['Yeah, so today was ok, late arrival. I\\'m not in the mood to write much, so..I probably will end up writing a ton. I always end up doing that when I say I don\\'t want to write much. Nothing interesting happened in any of my classes, and I only talked with a couple of good people including, \"You know who\"...except, you don\\'t know who, \"You know who,\" is. Oh well, no one reads this thing anyway. I made it to the top of the rock climbing wall today. Kelly and I intend to conquer the whole wall. It\\'ll be fun. Jazz was good fun as always...heh, and that\\'s really it. Have a lovely evening everyone, and I am off to sleepyland. (I actually didn\\'t write a lot. I\\'m shocked.)  *Ya di Amore*'], '19,November,2002': ['Yay, Tuesday...no longer Monday! Whoopie! Plus...late arrival tomorrow which is always good...except, we\\'ve only had it once, so yeah...I\\'ll shut up now. Anyway, my day was ok. I sat alone on the bus again! Yay, go being alone on the bus! Umm, I didn\\'t get to finish my EPVM homework before school because Mr. A wouldn\\'t let us in. What a poopeyhead. Anyway, yeah, I ended up just reading  There Are No Children Here . Great book, I\\'d suggest reading it. Depressing though. So, when we finally got in there, I was like, \"All right! I still have time to do homework,\" but then Nathan\\'s like, \"We\\'re still having sectionals.\" Now you see, we have four people in our trumpet section for jazz because one quit, and one of the kids in the section didn\\'t show up, so our sectional consisted of Nathan, Tom, and I just playing randomly. Oh fun! Nathan kind of forgot to give Alstadt his keys back after opening one of the practice rooms, and took them to math with him. I had to go find him, and get the keys from him. His math teacher kind of glared at me, but oh well. At least I missed warming up in WE. So, yeah, I tried doing the homework in WE, but of course there was Dan, Dave, Peter, and Don being mean...shock shock. At least Matt\\'s a nice kid. So, we played this song in WE (Wow, we played music in music class, woo!) and there was this one part that only 3rd and 4th trumpet play, and I was trying to play it right, but Dan was playing it wrong, and he was sitting next to me, so it\\'s hard not to go with what he\\'s doing.. So...we probably both messed up, and it just didn\\'t combine well, but of course...I was the one who got yelled at for it. Oh well. I\\'ll seek revenge on them someday. We talked about transposing in Music Theory, fun stuff, and they actually said that I\\'m too hard on myself. I thnk I\\'m not hard enough on myself. Moving along...EPVM (Nap time!) we talked about past tense, and whatnot. Very boring stuff. Umm, gym...heh, whoops, forgot gym shoes, oh well, it happens. So, I read all period. Math...ok, I was determined not to answer. I don\\'t like answering in that class...but, most of my class...arg...dumb as rocks. It\\'s really obnoxious. I\\'m not saying I\\'m an Einstein, but really people...so, I was finally forced to succumb to the evil math devil, and I answered. My math teacher is...well, to say the least a bit boring. Mr. Madsen...eek. Even the name is boring. Oh well...umm, lunch..watched Kelly beat Brett at chess...It was interesting. Comparative Religions was good as usual, and science was...boring, as usual. Talking to Alex and Joanne now.They\\'re really cool kids. Alex put me in his profile...he\\'s back on my nice list. :) Anyway...jazz after school was interesting, but gosh darnit!! I am SO bad at improv Why? I\\'m probably making it a lot harder than it should be, but...I\\'m just not the most outgoing person when it comes to playing my trumpet. I was told by a clarinet player that I have a small head, and you know good trumpet players. They all have really big heads, that of course meaning egos. So...possibly I just should have picked flute. Oh well...we just found out we\\'re supposed to have jazz combo on Tuesday\\'s. I had no idea, and already had plans I couldn\\'t cancel, so...now I feel awful for leaving them. Sorry guys...but yeah, I ate dinner, had a lesson, and now here I am...pondering the meaning of life...no not really, but oh well. Nothing more to write now, possibly more later....possibly... ~Ya di amore~'], '18,November,2002': ['Yeah, so this is just a place for me to vent about my, \"oh so horrible life in my bubble town.\" Sarcasm really is wasted online most of the time. I don\\'t know why I bother with it. It either sounds like I\\'m a mean horrible person, or I\\'m serious. Oh well, anyway, today was surprisingly good for a Monday. I got a pretty good night of sleep last night, and actually did my homework. Went to school, sadly on the bus...but at least I got to sit alone. Why sit alone you ask? It\\'s my only time to have, \"Alone time,\"  and I had my trumpet with me, so that kind of gets in the way. Anyway, I got to school, and of course said hello to everyone. Brandon was at least feeling a little better today which is good...except for the story that went along with it, which involved him, and ceramic (he, of course did not say that as politely.) Anyway, that was good. Carson came by to see me, and check on this alleged new mitten policy, and she wears mittens in school all the time, so of course she was upset. I made the rounds with her after that, saw cute Jake, a girl from Speech Team, and some other folks. The six minute bell didn\\'t ring so I was a bit late getting to Wind Ensemble. Meh, it\\'s ok. My trumpet section is crazy anyway. We were supposed to be doing sectionals, but that didn\\'t exactly happen...we sort of got yelled at by A. I played my music theory composition (which was horrid)  but I\\'m glad I got it over with. Mrs. Kane yelled at us about our Lit Analysis papers...no F\\'s but some D\\'s...that\\'ll be me. Anyway, rock climbing in gym today! Yay! It was super fun. I just want to do more of it. Ummm, then the rest of my day was even more uneventful than the first half, but I actually have no homework, so what am I supposed to do with my time? Something else productive? Psh. Yeah right. We didn\\'t end up having combo, which of course...was excellent, because I can\\'t solo...heh. We wont even go down that road, but anyway, then I came home, ate food, and here I am...being incredibly wasteful of my time, and writing this thing. I\\'ll write more later...maybe...if anything actually happens. Anyway, I\\'m out for now.  ~Ya di amore~'], '20,December,2002': ['Eventful day...well, sort of. Eventful to me considering I\\'m a loser with no life. I just got home from the second party I went to tonight. It was super-duper fun, as was the first party I went to....but, I\\'ll talk about that more later. Well, today was the last day before break, and it was dress up day, so naturally, I wore my dressiest outfit. Pajamas. They had stars on them. Quite nifty. Got the school newspaper, and there was this editorial (editorial being the operative word there, meaning that they ARE allowed to have opinions) in there that talked about teens and sex. They used band practice rooms, and band in general to prove their point. Honestly, I think people are making far too big of a deal out of it. It\\'s a stupid editorial. Editorials are supposed to get a rise out of you. They\\'re opinions. So, my opinion of the whole situation is to let it go, and be mature about it, but...many of the band kids beg to differ with me. Oh well. Anyway, this contraversial story was the highlight of my school day. Quite amusing. After school, I came home, blah-de-blah-de-blah, and then at 5:15\\'ish Carson picked me up, and we went to Noodles to celebrate her birthday. It was really fun. I got to meet some really awesome people. :) When we went in, these kids from Nequa stole our table. We plotted to get revenge, but never did. Then during dinner, this really creepy guy kept looking at us. He came at three different times during the meal looking through the window. *Shiver* Then, when we decided to go home and were standing outside waiting for Carson\\'s mom to come, this guy in a van asks us where Naperville Central is, so, being the polite kids we are, we told him. So, then he says, \"Are you sure?\"  We say, \"Yes, we\\'re sure.\" \"Do you kids go there?\" \"Yes.\" \"Are you sure?\" \"Yes.\" \"OK, so I take a left, then another left at the bell tower. Are you sure?\" \"Yes!\" Finally, after asking us about ten thousand times if we\\'re sure, he turns the corner, and we start talking, and we\\'re like, \"Didn\\'t he notice the jackets, and he asked, \"Are you sure,\" a heck of a lot.\" To our dismay, he was still basically right there. With his windows rolled down. Whoops. Oh well, that was my adventure at Noodles. Carson\\'s parents drove us home, and I went to Kathryn\\'s for her shindig. It was also tons of fun. We were looking at classified ads in the newspaper it was hilarious. \"HOT Victoria\\'s secret model. Likes to rollerblade, work out, talk, and MUCH more.\"  \"Great looking man looking for a vivacious woman to please me.\"  It was just too funny. Well, I should be off to bed now. I have to get up early the first day of Winter Break? How poopy is that? My brother has a bunch of friends over though, so, it\\'ll be hard to fall asleep with all the noise. I\\'ll just turn my music up. :) Anyway, I\\'m off to sleepyland. Goodnight everyone. Sweet dreams.  *Ya di amore*'], '18,December,2002': [':o) Hey...it looks like Alex. You know, the nose taking up the whole face kind of thing!! Except the smiley is MUCH cuter!'], '15,December,2002': [\"Wow, haven't written in a long time. Been pretty busy lately with Disney and then make-up work. Disney was a blast. Even the bus ride wasn't as bad as I expected it to be. it was actually kind of...well...fun. *Gasp* Yes well, I did enjoy myself at Disney, but it's nice to be home. I've created a theory about going on vacation with your friends. Don't. At least for more than two days. After about the second day, people started getting really sick of each other, and got very edgy. (Didn't help that the bus ride there was 31 hours.) Yes, well...I've finaly pretty much caught up with make-up work. Yay! I'm writing this feature story for journalism. I'm actually getting pretty into it. It's about Teenagers VS. Adults. It's pretty fun doing the research for it. Yes...but anyway....not talking about school anymore...it's evil. Our jazz band had a gig on Wednesday, and I got a ride, and was late getting there. I got there at the end of the last song...which is the song I had a soli in. Whoops...Oh well, it happens. Honestly, that's about all that's been going on, and now I'm off to the mall. I wish it would snow... *Ya Di Amore*\"], '14,January,2003': [\"Hehe, just finished dinner! Yum! I'm so happy right now. I don't even know why, I just...am! I'm talking to a bunch of my friends while writing this, which is always fun. Plus I'm doing homework, PLUS I'm watching Law  Order...how massively talented am I? Well, my day was pretty kick butt. Umm, no band OR music theory...very cool, so Kristen and I sat together and did homework and discussed Winter. Next period I hung out with Chris and Kelly for a bit (Alex too for a bit, since he was in Gym) and I left eventually. They started working on music, and...I just always end up feeling left out when they do, so, I try to stay away from those two together in general.Oh well, I went and sat alone in a practice room. Darn...no good stories for the newspaper to write about me. That was a great story, no matter how angry people are about the band comment. I wish people would have read the story actually, instead of reaching paragraph two and deciding it was terrible. Well, anyway, umm...EPVM was interesting. I'm getting nervous about my final. My brother said it was difficult...my brother with the perfect ACT AND SAT scores...arg. I just...wow, I'm so afraid of that test. I'm completely going to fail. Gym...oh jeez...two words  Commando Crawl  OWWWWWWWWWWWWWW  Good lord...that was one of the most painful...oh jeez...just thinking about it. Seriously, if you ever by some chance do that for high ropes...WEAR PANTS! Well, yes...wear pants normally, but don't wear shorts, make sure they are pants, because...it's quite painful if you don't. I made it through though, so it's all good! It just hurt...a lot.   Math, boring, shock shock.  Intervening thought: Why do I always write these while talking to Alex??  Lunch...was interesting. Just hung out with Kelly and Emily some, then Chris and Alex. It was cool...not much to it. Comparative Religion was boring...just, meh, presenting projects...and finally chem...boring, shock shock, and then, I came home, and did stuff, and that is the end of my day...therefore, I shall leave, and go kill alex...I mean...wait...you know NOTHING. You have no evidence...:)\"], '13,January,2003': [\"Avoiding homework...yet again, shock shock. plus i just painted my nails, and typing is something I can actually do without messing them up. I'll go back to homework in a bit. Umm, today was great! I saw *HIM* EEK! like four times. It was great...plus he actually NOTICED me, and spoke to me like...two out of the three times I talked to him. Exciting stuff.:) So, yes anyway, school wasn't bad. I went and sat with my best buds this morning instead of waiting outside the band room. It was fun. I miss seeing them as much as I do. Kathryn's doing well, she was just working on her paper, and of course Joanne and john were flirting. :) They make such a great couple. I get a little jealous at times though. I sort of wish I had someone like that. I'm still deciding who, and IF I want to ask someone to Winter. I would actually really like to go, but who to ask?? Certainly not *HIM* :) Couldn't do that. I figure I'll just go with a friend or something, and it'll all be good. OK...so, anyway, Kelly S. was cool as usual. She was complaining about stuff...as usual, but I love her to death just the same. Yeah, so...umm, went to band, Peter was gone, so...there wasn't AS much making fun of me as there usually is...oh darn. It was actually, ...scary as it is..., a bit unnerving. I actually got used to them all making fun of me every day, and it just wasn't balanced. Meh. Music theory was ok, but I'm still seriously thinking about dropping the class. I mean, I don't learn a lot, and I don't really enjoy the class too much. I could be doing more useful things with my time. Kelly..coyle that is got kind of angry with me about it. Oh well, I have to do what's best for me, and that may be what's best for me. EPVM...borring, as usual. We had a sub...so, whatever, nothing big. Gym..I went on high ropes!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! I was sooooooooooooooooooooooooooo scared. You have no idea. It was terrible...except, fun! I was so scared when I first went up there, but Mehgan and I kicked booty! We got three done today. We could have gotten more if Allen hadn't been an idiot...arg. What a silly boy! He went up there just so he could come back down right away. That's the only reason he wanted to go up. So that wasted a good ten minutes. My watch fell off while I was up there and I totally flipped out! Eek! Kelly got pretty mad at Erica...I don't know...I hope no one's mad at me right now. I just really don't like when people are mad at me.   Math was...arg. I've finally learned the trick to his teaching though. He's actually a pretty darn good teacher if you can stay awake in his class.

I'm really scared about this upcoming jazz competition. I know that we're not playing any songs that I really have to solo in, but still, there is Jumpin' at the Westside.

I just should have asked someone. This is a real bummer. EVERYONE, and I do mean everyone has a date to this thing...RAR....must go...bye.\"], '31,January,2003': ['RAR! I LOATHE 9-year-olds.  Yeah, oh, so here\\'s my crazy mixed-up story...  I went to the park today, because I really needed to think about some stuff and be alone, and, it\\'s the best place I know of to do that. Plus, it wasn\\'t THAT cold. So, yeah, I went to the park with my music, and swung on the swing while listening to music. Kinda makes me feel carefree. Ah, I love it! Anyway, so, I\\'m sitting there, not bothering anyone, just minding my own friggin\\' business.and suddenly...WHAM!!! This big wet gob hits me in the back. I was like...what the..? So, I frantically look around, and I see a bunch of kids standing behind me making snowballs. So, I\\'m like...fine, they must have hit me on accident. What weieners! So, I shook it off and went back to listening to music when suddenly...WHAM! Right in the back of the head. Arg. So, I turn my music off, turn around and say, \"What do you guys think you\\'re doing?\" They answer, \"throwing snowballs at you.\" I say, \"Why,\" and they say, \"Because you\\'re on our gangs territory.\" OK...so, this is getting a little annoying (they\\'re still throwing snowballs at me during this) and I say, \"What are you guys..like, 5?\" And they\\'re like, \"No! We\\'re 9!\" So, I just turn my music back on and go back to listening, and they keep throwing snowballs at me, and when I tell them to stop, they say, \"what, are you gonna call your mommy? Haha!\" So, I put up with it for a bit longer, and then ask the, \"gang leader\" what his name is. Mark Gianopolis, or something like that, and I tell him I\\'m going to call his mother. This, for some reason did not scare him. Heck, if some older kid told me that when I was 9, I would have piddled my trousers and ran away!  Whew, new paragraph, the other one was getting too long. Anyway, so....this kid actually CHALLENGES me about the mom thing. I would call his mom too if I thought that this Mark kid didn\\'t get his terrible attitude and manner from her. Arg, I dislike most Naperville people\\'s attitudes. Pooey. Well, anyway, finally, I just got so sick of their little, \"gang\" that I decided to scare them off. I told them that technically, this was assault and battery, and that I could call the cops, and have them deal with the situation. I told them it was a felony, and guess what?? They BELIEVED me! I was like...yes, small impressionable minds. So...they trudge off all confused, and I go back to my music, and thinking and whatnot, and they come back a few minutes later, and go, \"We have something to tell you.\" So, I say, \"What?\" And they go, \"We\\'re sorry, we thought you were just another high school kid who was going to be mean to us, and take over our territory.\" I go, \"Well, you do know this is public property?\" And the little kid says, \"No, my dad built the park! It\\'s our territory!\" And then he apologized again and left. Oh, and this is great...after a little while more, they yell to me, \"you know, you can come on our territory now.\" Psh.  As funny as it is, and as much as it made me laugh, it also made me incredibly sad. To think...little Naperville kids, doing this to people. They\\'re like a mini-gang. No, they aren\\'t going to seriously injure someone with a snowball, but still, jeez, what is this fricking world coming to?? I\\'m sick of it. Even in Naperville now, which I thought, even though it\\'s a snob town, at least it\\'s safe. Wow, that really does make me sad.  Well, until then, my day was pretty ordinary. Except for the bananas on the lockers. Haha, it was SO great, SO funny. It made my day, and like...no one noticed at first glance, and then they realized...whoa...wait....bananas??  We did opur presentation in American Government, which was fun. I think we did a good job actually!  was happy with it. Ummm....poor Scott, his Grandpa died. I really feel so bad for him. I know how that feels, and, it\\'s a terrible feeling. I didn\\'t want to bring up winter, even though I really needed to find out what was going on. I just felt so rotton for him. Poor Scott. :( Scott...here\\'s a smiley for you! :) You\\'re the coolest kid!  Diane was there this morning, but, she wasn\\'t there by 3rd hour chem, so, I think she may have left. I really hope she\\'s feeling better. I feel like I may have jinxed her. The day before she got sick, we were talking about how she never really gets sick with a fever and stuff, and how she hasn\\'t missed a day of high school yet, and...the next day. Wow...irony. It\\'s amazing.  Speech was kind of sad today. Ms. V was telling us about herself, and her personal life, and Will accidentally said something that he shouldn\\'t have, and Ms. V seemed to get upset. Eek...it was a REALLY uncomfortable moment, REALLY uncomfortable.   We got the newspapers today, and they had a retraction about the use of the term, \"band dorks,  but no retraction about Julia telling the incident. I think that\\'s perfectly logical. If she really saw it, then she does have a right to tell it. I certainly don\\'t think it was appropriate, or necessary, and...supposedly she did just do it to get back at band kids, although I can\\'t prove that. I still think the article was good, and that, honestly, if she really did see what she says she saw, then we have no right to stop her from saying it.   Oh crap!

Today was a pretty ordinary day anyway. We had late arrival though, which was cool. Mr. Alstadt wont be here for the next two days...oh darn! I was looking forward to music theory SO much too! Well, yeah, anyway. Nothing interesting happened until I got called down to Mrs. Plumbers...DUN DUN DUN! I didn't do anything, just a mix up, so it's all good now! :)  Then, we had jazz, and I am going to kill Nathan. I wish he'd act more like a section leader, and Tom wont shut up. I think Steve ought to be section leader. He actually cares about sounding good. So...then i came home from jazz, had my lesson, and that was about it. I know this was completely boring, but people get mad if I don't write, then they yell at me, and...arg. So tedious. Oh well...I'm off to...errr, read, or something. then sleep.   Also, my great uncle Al died a few days ago. He was the coolest guy ever. :) So, if you could all say a prayer for his wife, and really close family, I'd appreciate it. :) Thanks everyone, have a nice evening.

Thanks to Andrew sliding across the stinking floor this morning, I have a huge bruise on my back. Got my schedule...it's ok, but I'm going to try to switch lunch and health, since I got really light-headed and sick by the end of the day. Eek, it wasn't good.   Band and music theory stayed the same, so my first two classes were a cinch. Sometimes in band, Dan, and Peter, and the rest of them really get to me. Today was sort of one of those days. I really hadn't had a good start of the day, and I just didn't want to put up with them criticizing everything. Yeah...so, I'm not Tito...give me a break! It's not even something I'm going to pursue later on in life, I'm just having fun now, except, it's difficult for me to have fun when I have all these jerks sitting beside me. Arg.   Then...third hour Chem, which is a huge change for me, since I used to have it eighth hour. It's not too bad actually. Mr. Kordalewski (RAR! Stupid long named teachers!) seems pretty nice, and he's got the funniest accent. So, it's all good! I'm not a big fan of Chem though, soo...it kind of stinks, but Diane is in my class!!! I was so excited to see her! I was like...AHHHH DIANE! YAY! It was quite exciting. I sit in the back row corner...again, like last semester. What is it with me and back row corners?? Am I really THAT bad to look at? I suppose...but, oh well.   Then lunch, which sucks...fourth hour...royally sucks!!! No one's in it, and the lunch is too early. I'm going to try to get it switched tomorrow. I hope I can. I had to sit next to Pez for the first part...which was ok, but...the kid doesn't know when to stop talking. Like...seriously, he's really nice and all, but...I don't know, I just wish he knew when to stop talking more. Then halfway through the lunch hour, I met up with Kelly and Kathryn!!! YES! Thank you God...if I can't switch it, I still have two of my best friends. So, we just walked around and talked, and...it was fun. I kind of miss seeing them sometimes. We all went to this really dumb movie Friday night...but, without Nikki, and I miss her too. I really miss being around with a lot of my friends. I see band people every day, but I get the feeling they aren't really my friends. They pick on me a lot, and at first I just assumed it was all fun and games, but now...I sometimes feel like they all really don't like me. So...it's nice to hang out with non-band kids. Nikki's cheerleading squad made Nationals, which of course...is awesome! People laugh at me because one of my best friends is a cheerleader, and I just laugh right back, because they're missing out on a truly wonderful person! I miss Carson too. I know I see her like...every day, and I talk to her, but I kind of miss the way things used to be. Malevalent Sisters!! Carson, Nikki, and me...it was so cool....I just really miss Junior High sometimes. I can remember when I was 8, and I was REFUSING to turn 9. I actually refused! I kind of wish those days were back sometimes. Scott and I had a long conversation about this the other day, and...he reminded me of what fun it was to be younger. How I didn't have to worry about drinking, and all the stuff I'm completely not into! I miss my little group of friends...we used to do EVERYTHING together...and now it's just all breaking apart. Joanne's going to England, Carson's already gone from the group (thank goodness I still keep in close contact with her) and Nikki goes to Benet. I just...miss the old days.   Yeah, anyway....sorry....I just kept writing and writing, and I got off track. 5th hour, I had Speech, which was totally neat! I don't care what anyone says about her perkyness, I love Ms. V! Or as we call her...V-diddy! She's just so enthusiastic about teaching...like she actually wants to be there! She reminds me of Mr. Doman. I guess it's really easy to get a good grade in Ms. V's class, thank goodness, since I'm reallly nervous about giving speeches. Will is in my class :) I like him a lot. He's such a cool kid. He always wears this batman shirt that I love, and he's always really nice to me. He always seems kind of sad about something though...and it just, really reminds me of Kari's death. There's another person I miss a lot. Wow...I miss a lot of people right now....even Christy. Yeah...she did kiss Ryan...and yeah...I did dump his sorry butt, but...I still kind of miss her. She was just...so good to talk to. There's no one right now, that I really feel I could tell anything in the world to...like...just anything, and everything that's on my mind, and I wish there was.   Just turned on some Dave Matthews Band...I hope it puts me in a better mood. Honestly...I know it wont, but...I have to try, right??   Wow, I haven't written this much...possibly ever, and I've just gotten a little more than halfway through my day. I don't know what's up with me. I just...am thinking of how I wish things were, and, how fast things are changing. I mean...I'm already 37.5% of my way through high scool. That's pretty depressing, especially since I have no idea what I want to do after High School. *Sigh*   Well...yeah, back to speech, not much more to tell. I have a one minute speech to do tomorrow about myself. I think I'm going to talk about being albino. I hope it interests people. It's not something you hear talked about every day, soo...yeah.   Yeah....health....eek...scary class. Yikes...not much more to say than that, except...I have Stevey in my class!!! AHHH! Yay! Steve Zimnie...if you've never met the kid, meet him. He's the coolest ever. He's really nice, and he's really really cute. :) His girlfriend's lucky. Haha...and, I realized how bad that may have sounded...no, I don't like Steve as more than a friend, he's just really cool, so he deserved mentioning. I don't mention people I like...or do I?? Hmmm....  Ummm...ok, what's next? Math...yes, wont go into great detail about that, except, it's kind of cool since Taylor's in my math class, which is excellent, because Taylor is definitely the coolest. She's such a sweet person. I wish I could be more like her sometimes.   Then...American Gov.!! YAY! I have lots of people in my class...including Andre Cherry...haha...I kissed that kid when I was like...5. Ah...good times, good times. Kathryn's in my class, which is awesome, and so it Meredith, I don't care what ANYONE says about her, she's always really nice to me, and I think she's a cool person who has a lot to offer. Also...I have the coolest teacher, Mr. Albinak. He's such a great teacher. Kelly C. has him too, except...different period. And...yes, that was my day. It ended alright, but, I still am hoping to switch my lunch periods. I REALLY hope they let me. Anyway....I'm sick of typing, and I'm getting restless, so, I think I'll go read for a bit, and...maybe write more later. I'm actually writing down what I feel on here, which is kind of surprising. I don't usually actually write what I'm feeling.   Oh yeah...I guess there were like 20-25 bands in our section on Saturday...so, either we really didn't do as bad as I thought, or...the other bands were atrocious.   I haven't gotten to talk to Scott about Winter yet, and arrange things. I'm pretty sure we're going to Kathryn's to eat, then to the dance, and possibly Joanne's after, but...who knows?  I think I'm going to go for a little while...I'm kind of sad right now... Oh well...I hope everyone has a lovely evening. :)\"], '26,January,2003': ['Wow...I can\\'t believe it. I almost wish I could have seen more class AA bands. JSO didn\\'t win any awards...which, completely shocked me. I mean...they are awesome.

I had a great day Satuday! Kelly drove me home. It was amazing. I mean, I've known this girl since I was like...18 months! It's just so weird to be in the passenger seat and not have a parent there, so yeah, kathryn's house was super duper fun...I was surprised, like seriously. I had a GREAT time. I felt really bad though since I kind of went last minute, and I tried to call Diane's cell, but I kept getting a busy signal, and, arg, it was bad!  But anyway...yeah, the night was great...until I got home. I had a long talk with Kelly C., and...I've just been a horrible friend to both Kelly and Emily for the past 6 months. I don't want to go into details, because the past is the past, and...I can't change it, but....I apologized and truly meant it.   Then today, I talked to them both individually, and...I definitely got off too easy, but they forgave me! I seriously couldn't believe it. They forgave me within a matter of seconds. I was just so happy and shocked...and...relieved. I didn't lose two of my best friends. Phew! Yeah, I definitely did get off easy, they forgave me way too fast, but...no complaints here. It taught me a huge lesson though. I'm never ever taking my friends for granted again, and I'm definitely going to think of how a friend would feel, rather than how I feel about the situation, because I'm going to feel differently about things than other people are, and I'm going to be really layed back about something that could be really important to a friend, and I have to respect that.   Phew...so, huge rollercoaster weekend that let me end up on the top! I'm feeling great right now, my only worry, would be that Kelly and Emily don't believe how sorry I really am, but...I think they do. :) I have such great friends. I'm really lucky.   My day today was cool. Didn't do anything too special. Kath was gone during government though, so I was sad.  We watched this really sad video in health. It was an Oprah show with Dr. Phil, and it had this girl on it who was raped when she was 13, and now she's bulemic, and she tried to kill herself, and it was just so depressing. Joanne and I sat in the back corner and joked for the first half, but...when the girl came on, we stopped. It was too sad. I wish Kelly sat near me. She's in my health class too. Like, I want Kelly to sit in front of me, and Joanne next to me, or vise versa, and it'd be a perfect world...well, for Health at least.  I actually have friends in my classes this semester. Yeah, last semester I had music theory, but...not much else where I had friends. It's great!   Yeah, anyway, I'm going to go...no homework to do, but, I'm still going to go. I think I may go read.

Oh yeah...Chris and Jim won since they both went into a girls locker room. Haha. We found the weight room!!!!! Bryan won, he was nice...except for the whole shpeal at the end of the day, Mike Klos lost, and Diane definitely won because she\\'s Diane, and diane doesn\\'t lose. Also...I don\\'t steal ideas like this from people who lose.   Yeah, so...more about the girls bathroom, because it was just hilarious.

Well...we didn\\'t get a chance to let them know that THERE WAS SOMEONE! This chick was walking down the stairs headed for the locker room. Kelly and I tried to hold the door shut, but we couldn\\'t say anything since we were laughing too hard. So they walk out, and this girl sees them, and just gives the WEIRDEST look! It was the funniest thing I\\'ve seen in a long time! It completely made my day! Also, in their weight room, they have this like..conveyer belt type thing with rocks on it so you can rock climb.

I really just wanted to go to be there for Diane, but Christine was there, and she was cool. I had never really gotten to know her. She\\'s actually an awesome person. I had no idea, since I didn\\'t know her well. So, a couple good things came from going to pep band.  Anyway, I went to Kathryn\\'s house for a little bit on Thursday night. I got there too early though and sat in her living room with her mom and brother watching, \"Driving Miss Daisy.\" I guess I\\'ve been friends with Kathryn so long that it wasn\\'t awkward being with her mom and brother. I walked in there kind of worried, thinking it was going to be realllly uncomfortable, and terrible, but it was fine. I was actually pretty comfortable being with Kath\\'s family.

I feel like I need to for some reason, like there\\'s no way I could feel good in any other band. Even though Peter/Dan/Don/Dave/Matt all make fun of me, I stil can\\'t imagine myself in another band.  I heard Dan did really well on his audition. I know it\\'s a terrible thought, but...that makes me so mad. It\\'s terrible, but I wanted him to fail, and do horribly. Jeez. I really wish he had. I guess that makes me a bad person, or does it? I mean, everyone in some small way hopes their competition does badly.   Wow, that\\'s not helping, I\\'m still feeling guilty.  I\\'m so worried about this audition. It\\'s all I think about! Seriously. I can\\'t think of anything else. It\\'s horrible. I need to start thinking of something else.  I wish I could have gone to variety show with Jim, but my parents got home too late.

Maybe.I would have made WE.  Wow, I do. I really have this sinking feeling that I didn\\'t make it. I want this weekend to be over. I want to find out either way. I HAVE TO KNOW either way. I\\'ll probably be devastated if I didn\\'t make it, but hey.  Why does this mean so much to me? It\\'s not even what I\\'m going to do when I, \"grow up.\"  I\\'m a loser.  OK, I\\'m going to type about something NOT RELATED TO THIS STUPID AUDITION!!! I promise I wont mention it. Sorry...anyway, yeah. I went to Nikki\\'s birthday party last night, and it was...interesting. It was fun, and I met a lot of new people, but...everyone from Benet was so......perky. They were nice, just...perky. Usually it\\'d be ok, but...I had a headache, and I was flipping out about...ahhh! I promised I wouldn\\'t talk about it, so yeah. I came home and went right to bed pretty much. I was tired.  I can\\'t get my mind of this thing no matter what I do. I tried checking the website to see if they posted it or anything, but...they didn\\'t.   I feel like I\\'m going to cry, and I don\\'t know why. I think it\\'s the sinking feeling. Like, the feeling that if I don\\'t make Wind Ensemble, I\\'ll dissapear into an abyss of nothingness, and probably be incredibly sad. The feeling that I\\'ll be a failure at the one thing people say I\\'m pretty good at. I\\'m really scared. Really scared, and I don\\'t like it. The fear that I\\'ll dissapoint my parents, and bonny, and...myself. I will be so incredibly dissapointed in myself if I don\\'t do well on this audition. I already am dissapointed in myself for not working on it more. Oh jeez...I\\'m starting to cry. This is terrible.  On a completely different note...Heh, I realized the other day how few people I truly trust. It takes me a long long time to trust people. I don\\'t know. I feel kind of guilty because people tell me so much. I think I should tell them stuff too, but...I can\\'t bring myself to do that. It\\'s like I can\\'t be open and honest, like it\\'s not possible for me except in a few cases. Like I have these big metal bars in front of me that I can\\'t get past, like I\\'m a prisoner in a cage that I could easily escape from.  I\\'ve tried to be more trustworthy, but...it\\'s impossible.  Why the heck am I so depressed right now?? I hate it!!! I hate being the snobby Naperville kid who\\'s depressed over nothing, who\\'s got good food, shelter, friends, and a family that\\'s awesome.  What do I have to be depressed over?

Dan didn\\'t show up. Darn. I was so sad. Well, not really. In band we just signed yearbooks still. I didn\\'t have many people sign mine. Kind of funny how I don\\'t know many people in my band. I didn\\'t know a lot of the seniors when we went down the line and shook their hands yesterday. Basically just Allie and Katie, and Danny, and Max. Music theory was of course, boring!!! I loathe that class so much. So so very much. I only like it because I sit with my friends. Chemistry was ok. We got our tye-dye shirts back. Mine wasn\\'t great, but it was ok. Diane\\'s was extremely good. I\\'m glad. I think it made her feell good since everyone was like, \"Whoa, Diane, yours is SO perfect! It was cool. We talked about stuff with Kathryn and whatnot.

Not again. I can\\'t take it.  Then we went to the assembly and I was going to sit with Diane, but then Carrie came, and...when we went in the bleachers I wasn\\'t even sitting next to Diane. Not that there\\'s anything wrong with Carrie. She\\'s really really nice from the few times I\\'ve talked to her, but then I saw Kathryn and I wanted to talk with her so I sat with Kathryn and Kelly. It was a really long assembly, and really warm in the bleachers and ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh, it wouldn\\'t have been bad if I hadn\\'t been sitting between some lady who laughed like a wicked witch and Matt. Matt just doesn\\'t know when to stop or even when not to start as someone else said today. He\\'a really a nice kid...but, argh. Oh well. The assembly was actually kind of sad. Zach won a lot of awards. It\\'s too bad that he wasn\\'t there to accept them. :( That\\'s just so terribly sad. I can\\'t imagine what it\\'s like for his parents. Their only child. His parents were there though. Then, the goodbye to Mr. Paulsen was nice. They played the song, \"Time of your life,\" and I really love it, but unfortunately it always makes me sad. What I find ironic however is that it\\'s really a sarcastic song, but...they always use it in goodbye videos for High School and whatnot. I guess it could be easily taken seriously. Paulsen was a good principal too. He always came to our band stuff and whatnot when he could. He\\'s a good guy.   So, after the assembly finally ended, and after I didn\\'t even get to talk to Kathryn, I went to health. We just talked about more STD\\'s. It was, umm...exciting? I\\'m really glad I decided a while ago to remain abstinent until marriage, because I\\'d probably be freaking out after all this. So many grody STD\\'s. Hmmm. Speech was good. Bob gave a speech on butter. Haha, Bob\\'s a great kid. I love my speech cloass. Everyone is so nice to each other and it just...rules.   Hm, lunch was good. We sat outside. I kind of miss the floor sadly. I know it\\'s weird having to get up every day when they sweep, but I don\\'t care. that\\'s where I feel comfortable. Lunch was still good. We all just talked and whatnot. My two groups are sort of merging, so that\\'s cool. I can spend time with all of them at once. YaY! I haven\\'t seen Nikki in a long time unfortunately though. I think we\\'re growing apart. Oh well. I\\'m really excited to see Finding Nemo with Emily and Mary Clare and Kathryn and Kelly on Friday. It will definitely be a fun time.   Math was boring as usual. We just went over our review packets and whatnot. I actually know a lot in it. I\\'m shocked. I loahte math so much. What an annoying subject. And finally, government was cool. I got a chance to talk with Kathryn. We were sort of supposed to be doing our study guides but...yeah....that didn\\'t really happen. She\\'s having serious doubts, thank goodness. I mean...I\\'m trying to not get her really angry with me, but at the same time...definitely let her know my opinion. Nobody wants her to go out with him. Her parents don\\'t even like him. That\\'s got to say something. I really don\\'t trust him, and I love Kathryn and don\\'t want her hurt.

So, then we decided we'd do something else like bowling or a movie or something, but...I'm having second thoughts. I think if I do see him, I'll start liking him...again. I realllly don't want that, because a relationship with us just doesn't work. I obviously broke up with him for a reason last time. Why bother puting myself through that again? It just hurt me and him, and it took a while to get our friendship back. But, I guess I'm not really being a friend to him if I don't want to see him. I know if I do, I'll end up going out with him at the end of the day, and yeah...I've thought about doing that, but...it's partly because I just want to be in a relationship with someone. Hmmm, oh well. Tonight was fun. I went to Peter's party. It was excellent...well, I guess. It was alright, but I didn't know anyone, and Chris and Brandon went to play video games. Luckily, Kelly was there, and Annie too. I'm glad I'm friends with those two. Hmmm, so I left the party kind of early and just hung out with Chris for a bit. It was cool.   That's really about it. I guess I'm just really worried about this thing tomorrow. I felt like I was being a jerk to Chris. I was listening to him, just...not all there. Sigh. I guess what wants to happen will happen. I shall see, I shall see.\"], '10,June,2003': [\"Today was so dull and boring I don't even really want to write about it. Heh.

Why? Because of meany pooface Alstadt. He's such a jerk sometimes. I'm sorry, but he is. Anyway, I just sat around before school IN THE BAND ROOM! I couldn't believe it was open. Heh, funny. It was open and guess who wasn't there? Anyway, I went to go take my speech final, and it was easy and all. I got a B on it without studying at all. It's ok. I'll still get an A in the class. I could have gotten a 68% on it.Excellent. Anyway...I did that, then went to band. Since we took the band final on Friday, there was nothing to do. I KNEW if I stayed Id' have to sort commencement music since we had to let it all dry out yesterday. So, Kelly and I decided to be rebels! WOO HOO! We walked to burger king and got some food. It was awesome. We got kids meals, and we got the toys that went along with them! It rocked! So, then we walked back, and no one seemed to notice. :) Excellent. Alstadt took attendance, but...no big deal. They aren't going to come after me with two days of school left. Also, my parents wouldn't care anyway. So, then, unfortunately, we had to go to music theory. It wasn't as bad as I thought. I proved Alstadt wrong though! YES! He said I couldn't go from A major to C major and have it sound good. HA! Not like my composition was good, but it still sounded ok, and Mr. A was wrong!!! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!  Anyway, that was pretty much it today. Oh yeah, with our kids meals, Kelly and I got these scratch and sniff thing. Oh my gosh, there was one with a foot, and it smelled SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO bad. Wow! Terrible.   Anyway, I'm done. I think I'll go...I don't know, do someonething constructive?\"], '08,June,2003': [\"So yeah...I just love being the one not paired up with anyone. Feels fantastic. Really.

A few of my really really good friends are going, and it'll be hard without them here. I doubt they'll miss me at all. Oh well.   Oh yeah! I cleaned my bathroom today too. Blah. I hate cleaning my bathroom. I hate cleaning altogether actually. I hope I'm rich when I get older so I can hire someone else to do that, or I'll try to marry someone who likes to clean. Ha. Like that'll happen. I mean the marrying part, not the finding someone who will clean part. :)   Anyway, talking to kelly. I'm going to miss her.

Everyone has a place that they think in, and that just happens to be mine. I don't even know why. It just relaxes me. It helps me filter my thoughts. I think way too much for my own good, and I just...can't think in my house. It's not that my family doesn't give me privacy. They certainly do, but...still.

I\\'m going to Joanne\\'s on Thursday to watch Hitch Hiker\\'s since it kind of got ruined last time. Eh, oh well. I kind of wasn\\'t expecting much when I went to her house in the first place since I knew Kathryn was going. I mean, wow, that sounded mean, but what I meant by that was that Kathryn hasn\\'t read the books or anything, so...it really wouldn\\'t have been much fun for her probably. We probably wouldn\\'t have ended up watching the shows anyway, which is what happened. It was ok, since we went walking and to the park and stuff but, eh. Oh well. Stuff happens. And then tomorrow night, I guess Brett mentioned doing something with Erica and Roger. I have no clue who Roger is, but...that\\'s ok. I hope we all end up doing something. I\\'ve never hung out with Brett outside of school. I think it would be fun. I really respect him as a person. So, we\\'ll see if we all end up actually going.  Sigh, I\\'m sleepy, but I can\\'t sleep. Ridiculous. Oh well. I\\'ll just keep typing and hopefully I\\'ll get tired soon. I\\'m still excited for Michigan haha. I feel like such an idiot, but I am!! I haven\\'t seen Conor in a year, and I don\\'t really know Dan all that well, so it\\'ll be cool to get to know him better, and of course Sara and Lauren, I\\'m always excited to see. They\\'re fun to be with. And now Sara doesn\\'t drink anymore so I\\'m even more excited about that! Someone else to hang out with when everyone goes drinking. I still need to call Lauren to make...errr....plans  to get certain people back. Heh. Heh. I met this really really incredibly cool kid today. I would love to hang out with him if he lived around here, but eh. Such is life.   I miss Kelly and Chris. I think it\\'s weirder not having Chris around though. I mean, Kelly, I hadn\\'t had the chance to hang out with yet this summer at all, which I fully intend to change. I\\'ve been emailing her everday, well...except the past two days. My emails all messed up. Grrrr! But, Chris...is weirder. Like, it\\'s weirder having him gone. I\\'m so used to his presence. I talk to him at least once a day, or see him, so...it\\'s just strange to think, \"oh I have to tell Chris this\" and then not be able to. Hmmmm, I guess being tired makes me write more or something. Hey, I think I am tired! I think I\\'m going to go try to sleep again soon. I hope it works this time.  I\\'m kind of confused about some stuff right now, and I just wish I knew what ...I guess, what certain people think of me. Sometimes I really really just....want to know what people think of me, all of it. Good or bad, I just want to know, and other times, I completely fear it. I avoid asking people questions that might make them tell me what they think of me. Heh, I avoid a lot with people. It\\'s really terrible.   Oh, oh!!! I\\'m going to the DT concert July 19th. I am SO excited. So so so so soooooo excited. I\\'ve never been to a concert before, and I get to go to this one with awesome people. It\\'s going to be Kelly, Jim, Alex, Chris, me, and this kid Tony. I\\'ve never really talked to Tony before but, but he was in my P.E. Leadership class first semester. He seemed like a cool kid. Alex made me a bunch of CD\\'s, like 10 I think of excellent music. I\\'m excited to get them from him. He\\'s such a nice kid. :) I offered to pay him for them but he was like, \"No!\" Heh. I have some awesome friends.   I think when Kelly gets home I\\'m going to see if she wants to just get together, hang out, and look at Germany pictures, maybe watch Monsters Inc. again. :) Such a great movie. I hope things are ok with Diane now...I think they are, but I don\\'t know. I think I\\'ll call her tomorrow. I\\'ll see what she\\'s doing. See if she wants to go shopping or something. Hm, I haven\\'t been shopping in a while! That sounds fun...:) I guess it all depends on what time I wake up and how I feel. I\\'m not feeling so great right now. My tummy really hurts. Argh.

Oh well. I'll call her later and apologize. I didn't mean to bring my bad mood down on her, and I really did appreciate that she invited me. That was probably the one good thing about that day.

I have like...ten! Who needs that many hoodies? Anyway, I also bought a new purse, and another black and white type shirt. I think I need pastels in my wardrobe. Ah well. I like dark colors so I\\'m sticking with them. I also got a really neat silvery sparkly belt, and then I got a picture frame. I\\'m going to stick my favorite picture of my grandma on one side, and then...I don\\'t know.

It was, \"I love you Grandma, see you soon,\" and she said, \"You too Catie.\" I could tell she was upset. She knew as well as I did that I wouldn\\'t get to see her again. I guess those are great last words to say to someone though. I\\'m glad I got the chance to say them to her, and I\\'m glad that I did spend last summer in Michigan. Yeah, I was sort of alone, but I had my cousins, and I really like being alone. My family worried about me because I liked being alone so much. They thought I was really really depressed. I don\\'t see them that often, so I understand why they thought that, but that just made me feel even worse, because I didn\\'t want them thinking I was really depressed and worrying about me along with Grandma. *Sigh* I need to go do something to get myself out of this. I don\\'t really want to go read. Well...I do, but I need to stop. I\\'ve been reading so much by the end of summer, I\\'m not going to have anything to read anymore. I\\'ve gotten like...addicted to reading. I think I\\'m going to read that book, \"God\\'s Debris,\" tomorrow. It\\'s had a really strong impact on everyone who has read it so far, so we\\'ll see how much my beliefs hold up. I\\'m pretty sure they will. I mean, I\\'m open-minded, but I do have a strong set of beliefs, and I guess we\\'ll have to see if this book changes anything.  I\\'m having my mom read it too, but...not my dad I don\\'t think. I think it would just make my dad mad. My dad\\'s beliefs are like...set in stone. Nothing changes his opinions. NOTHING. So, I know all this book will do is make him mad. I\\'m sure of it. Hmmmm, what else could I do? I don\\'t know if I really want to watch TV, and I don\\'t want to watch a movie, because look at what the last movie I watched by myself did to me. Poo. The Breakfast Club would be ok, but I don\\'t have that soo...nevermind. I could go turn off my away message and actually talk to people. Nah. Forget that. I don\\'t know if I can handle talking to people right now. I feel like if I talk to the wrong person I\\'ll end up making myself mad. I could go to bed, but...not quite yet. Ah well. I\\'ll find something. Maybe there is something good on TV since it\\'s the Fourth of July. Kind of funny how I didn\\'t do anything today that was Fourth of July\\'ish.

We all couldn\\'t just decide on a movie. We finally did decide on The Breakfast Club! But than...we realized it was rated R. Haha, we spent forever deciding if we should risk going and trying to get it. Mary Clare had her mom\\'s card with her, but still.

I don\\'t think he cared that much, or the card was fine or something. So, then we went to Mary Clare\\'s and watched it. Ohhh! It\\'s such an awesome movie! It made me happy. I guess I can see why they rated it R in the 80\\'s. I mean, it wasn\\'t bad, but it just had a ton of swearing in it, and I guess some sexual inuendo...

We just talked about where we want to go to college, and what we want to do in life, and just some serious stuff. I don\\'t know what I\\'ll do without them when we all go to different colleges. It\\'ll be weird not having them to always go to.   So, after a while, we decided we wanted to go out or something, so we went to Colonial, which was fun too.

OK, I\\'m back and there\\'s SO much to write about right now. AHHHH! I don\\'t even know where to begin.  First off, I missed the DT concert sadly. It was today, and someone told me it was the 30th or something, and the thing is, I was supposed to come home yesterday but we decided to come home a day later which I am actually very VERY happy for, because my last night there was absolutely AMAZING. haha. Such good times. The whole trip was just, so much fun, I think it\\'s the most fun I\\'ve had up there ever. Basically, my uncle has this cottage, and we go up there the second week in July every year and then there\\'s like, this strip of cottages that are connected, There\\'s like, 5 little cottage suite things, and then there\\'s what we call the honeymoon sweet, and the efficiency bellow that. And these things are all connected, and we rent out the whole place. It\\'s just what we do. The owner knows we do. It\\'s sort of a dump place, but...it\\'s like tradition. People have been staying there for as long as I can remember, and it\\'s pretty cheap partially because my uncles take care of a lot of stuff there and clean out the pool and whatnot, but yeah, we rent out the whole place and it\\'s tons of fun. It\\'s called the Terra. That\\'s not where I stay though. I stay at my uncle\\'s cottage which is really really nice, and the beach is right there, and you can go down anytime you want and whatnot. So, everyone in my family comes pretty much, 4 uncles, 5 aunts since one of the aunts divorced her husband who is actually my blood relative, but I haven\\'t seen him in years. Heh, kind of funny how I keep in contact more with his wife and kids than with him considering his wife isn\\'t blood related and stuff, but yeah...Then there\\'s my mom and dad, and my brother even went up this year, and then I have all my older cousins, Joanna, Diana, Paula, Patrick, Chris, Brian, and Erin Chris\\' wife, and then friends of the family, the shantas, Sam and them, and then Meghan and Chelsea and Nicole. Chelsea and Nicole are like...fricking demon spawn, but....perhaps I\\'ll get to that later. Meghan\\'s really really cool though. I\\'d never got to know her before this trip, and it was awesome. She\\'s so so nice. Then there\\'s Shalane, and heh, I think that\\'s it for older people up there. Haha, wow sometimes it amazes me how many people all go up there. THEN, heh, there\\'s the kids my age, my three cousins who are all within a year and a half of my age (I\\'m the oldest in that little group, yay) Sara, Lauren, and Max were all there, and of course Max brought Conor up who he\\'s been bringing up for like...six years now. And then finally, there\\'s the younger kids, Daniell, Sara\\'s little sister, and Peter Max\\'s little brother, and then Peter\\'s friend Dieter. Heh, I think it\\'s cute how they\\'re best friends and their names rhyme, but I\\'m weird like that. SO, that\\'s all the people I think haha. Wow. So many. But, Max, Conor, Lauren, Sara, and I all hang out together and whatnot. I\\'ve got so many more inside jokes after this trip with them...  TJ the Taliban job, bus or butt slut, FS the boat slut, opperations abomination, anialation, and denomination, chillin\\' in the \\'ator, walking into invisible glass doors, the mother, the prude, and the drunken cheerleading slut, Theo, Red Dragon (did we FINALLY see it?) evil bumper boats, yokels, creepy old lady checking us out, Chhhhrrriiiissss, 50 back rubs, loner? pepper? Sara\\'s plot to kill Conor, drills, someone\\'s in the kitchen with Dina..., \"I love you guys!\" Steal the dear, step one...get regina girls, go-karts, and what\\'s scary is that this list could probably keep going a lot longer...  We just went over to the Terra every night basically and hung out, and did stupid stuff, and kept getting told to get up and go actually do something because all we would do would be sit around. The beach was awesome too, going on the jetskiis. That was SO sweet. I went on with max, and I got up to like...63 mph, and I did a bunch of pretty difficult turns.

And...we only fell off once, and that was because I jumped off because I thought we were going to tip over haha. Sara threw Conor off THREE times. It was crazy.   Wow, it\\'s hard to even explain what a good time I had. I mean, it just rocked so much, and then last night was the best of all, but I don\\'t want to write about that in here. Haha.

It's the first song that made me cry over her. Like, I didn't understand why I wasn't crying. I was upset, just not crying, and when I heard this song I just burst into tears. The song's not even really about that. The song would be about me dieing. But, I just listened to this song so many times after I first heard it, and truly admitted to myself that she was gone.

Hopefully I\\'ll get to go out with Mary Clare, Kelly, and Kathryn later tomorrow too.  And today....I didn\\'t do much. I went out to lunch with Chris and Jim. That was fun. I was really quiet though. I don\\'t know. I was off in my own world then for some reason. My other world rocks. Heh. Wow, I\\'m weird.   I don\\'t really want to go back to school on Tuesday. I have a feeling I\\'m going to get that stressed out feeling again for some reason. I have no idea, but I just feel like this year will be all stress and no fun. I don\\'t think I\\'ll end up going to any dances...again. Homecoming Freshman year wasn\\'t so bad, but...eh. I don\\'t know. I just don\\'t want to go back to the homework either. I still have U.S. History homework that I have to do this weekend. It\\'s only been three days. Ahhh.   I\\'ve been thinking, I\\'ve changed a lot since High School started. I\\'m not sure how, but I feel like I\\'ve changed. I feel like I\\'m not crazy old me anymore. I\\'m less gregarious. I\\'m turning into a secluse. I never would have thought that of myself two years ago. Catie? Alone? No way!   Good song playing...  Today is gonna be the day that they\\'re gonna throw it back to you By now, you should have somehow realized what you gotta do I don\\'t believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now...

But anyywayyy, we finally managed to track him down, and we met up with him and Steve and Matthew after they came back from the concert. We went to McDonalds and then to Ranchview. It was just a lot of fun. I got a chance to talk to Bryan which was really nice, and I'd never hung out with Steve before so it was cool!   Marching earlier today was ok. I mean, I don't know. I guess it was kind of cool being on the radio, but right now I'm being really optimistic about everything so....catch me when I'm in a bad mood and I'll say it sucked like no other.

And he gave me whipped cream, but we wont go in to that inside joke. So, we just ate the cookie during band. It was quite tasty.   So, that was a really really nice start to my day.

We were kind of planning to meet with Nikki and them too, but I guess they didn\\'t want to come up to the parking garage where we were because it was too cold. We were on the top floor burning incents sitting in the back of Chris\\' car. It was really funny. This cop car came by and he was really nice about it, but he\\'s like, \"I\\'m gonna need you guys to move.\" so, we did, and we went to school. Haha. How ironic. to be at school on a Friday night. We went into the band room and jammed for a while. Very cool, very coo. I refused to outright solo though so...eh. Then we just took everyone home which took like...half an hour haha.

So, we did our stuff and went and had an AWESOME show! :) YaY!! And then we got into regular clothes and went and sat in the stands all together. It was soooo cold but I sat between bryan and Chris so...that was better. Plus, I got a sunburn from yesterday during rehearsal so that warmed my face nicely. :)   And so we watched the other bands and such and then....the awards....  We go first!!!!! It was amazing. We got first in our class. that's just so neat considering where we were freshman year. WOW! We got outstanding percussion, and outstanding visual. We didn't get music or guards sadly. :( Oh well, it's ok. I think we got third overall or something like that. Yeah yeah! It rocked. then on the way home, nathan and I switched buses which was really fun because we went to the party bus and we sang all the way home and were just loud and happy although our bus driver was kind of mean....poo on her.   Afterwards, I went to stake N Shake with both Chris', Nathan, and Carrie. Lots and lots of fun. Then we went and dropped Carrie off and just drove around and talked for a while.

Now, I guess kidney stones are supposedly sometimes worse than childbirth. So...ow. So, I'm sitting there like...not even able to cry because that kind of movement would hurt, and actually vomiting because the pain is so bad. It was really just...awful.   So, then I had to go get a CAT Scan. that was a little scary but oh well. I wont know the actually results until a few hours, but...that's most likely what it is because I have all the symptoms.  Why am I so happy now you may wonder? Pain pills.....heh, beautiful things. I'm not usually a big pill taking person but it hurt SO much and...haha, now I'm happy. A wee bit out of it but happy nonetheless. I'm really worried about tomorrow though. I honestly do want to go, but i guess we'll have to see what the doctor says about that one.

They're not too seriously injured. I think maybe a broken leg, but gosh...it was just such a shock. Then Peter was a witness so we had to stay for a bit until the police said we could go.

That�s for my next rant�  Well, now that that�s out of the way, I can go on to bigger and �better? No, not better, well, at least bigger things. Today was a Monday. And I mean that in the true sense of the definition. My energy (what minute amount I began with) tapered off by�oh 6:45. I woke up at 6:00�ish. 45 minutes of energy. And if only 45 minutes of energy isn�t bad enough, it was wasted on the morning. Mornings are evil too. Wow, there�s so much evil in this world. Or maybe I�m just eccentric. Either way�it bites.

It was nice actually, but the mood was blah. Actually, �blah� is really a poor word to describe the mood. It was more, �We�re really mad at the world, so�let�s vent!� but, is there a word for that? I don�t know. I think I need to start reading the dictionary before I go to sleep every night.   U.S. History was tedious as usual and Sat/Com was actually my relief of the day.

He asked me, �Are you alright?�  Not many people truly ask me that. Actually, no one�s sincerely asked me that in a long time. Maybe my mother. If I didn�t think it�d freak him out, I probably would have just started to tell him everything that�s going on. What I�m thinking and such.  You know�the amazing part of this all is I�m not PMS�ing. Heh. I was just thinking to myself, �Why the heck are you in such a bad mood?� And I though PMS instinctively, but I realized that�s not it so I�m sure there�s something else.

I haven't written a real entry in so long for me. I've missed not writing in here. A lot's going on right now too. Most of it I can't really talk about in here but...still. It's nice to have blogger back to vent some frustrations. I think I'm giving up on numero 3. I don't think I care enough anymore as odd as it sounds. I don't know. Maybe this is all just because I'm having a particularily bad week but still, I'm feeling like I'm not going to bother with it anymore. I don't even feel right liking him. It's just making me feel weird now.   Anyway, today I went out to lunch with Kelly, Kath, and MC. Good times. So much fun at Noodles. And tonight, I think I'm going to go to that dance thing at school with them. I have to be there to make sure Kathryn does what she's supposed to do.   I guess now I'll go...I don't know. There's no homework to do and...WOW! This is amazing. There's nothing to do and I love that. I think I'll go watch TV. That's fun and I haven't done that in a long time.    In spite of my crappy week which will probably exceed crappy tomorrow...I'm content at this instant and it's a nice feeling.\"], '21,January,2004': [\"Well, I got history over with.

Care enough about you to know when you're upset, not to mess with you or tease you or be mean to you but just to be there and care about you.

He doesn't even know why I'm upset and he's being there for me because he knows I need him. I just think that's so cool and I love him to death for it. YaY Chris! :)\"], '19,January,2004': ['Well. I actually did something for finals. I read the story, \"the Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner,\" for my Satire and Comedy final. Now, I just have to make an outline and find quotes and stuff.

There\\'s only one thing I want to work on with driving before my actual test. Parking. Ugh. I suck at parking. Honestly. I\\'m just horrible at it.   Oh well. We shall see.

That\\'s awesome. :) i mean, I love jazz but...it\\'s nice to have a day off once in a while.   So, anyway, since I haven\\'t written in a while....maybe I\\'ll catch up. I already wrote about Winter, which I guess is the best/most important thing that\\'s happened in the last few days. I don\\'t think I even wrote in here I was planning on asking anyone. Haha. Actually...I hadn\\'t until Saturday sooo....I guess that makes sense that I didn\\'t write in here.  I think I might be getting sick unfortunately. :( My throat\\'s starting to get pretty soar and every time I yawn or something like that, my ear hurts so I\\'m thinking I might have an ear infection. Ick. Nooo fun.   I think I\\'m going to really like my classes this semester. Maybe not weighted essay writing but eh...you can\\'t have everything, right?   Wind Ensemble\\'s pretty much the same. I got kicked out the other day. :) That was actually rather funny. We were playing Gavorkna fanfare and I can double tongue sometimes and sometimes I can\\'t and he told me to play alone in front of everyone and I was like...\"ummm, no. I can\\'t,\" and he\\'s like, \"go practice it then.\" And I just got up and I left. I think he expected me to stay and actually play it but I was like...\"no, not in front of everyone.\" And then, today we didn\\'t have band since they\\'re all at IMEA :) Whoo. So, I sat around during band trying to do the homework I didn\\'t do last night. That didn\\'t work at ALL.   Second hour, I now have History. That\\'s a big switch for me since I used to have it seventh. I have Mr. Rosanova too, which is cool. He seems like he\\'s going to be a good teacher. I mean, we\\'ve gotten homework every night, but it wasn\\'t difficult. So, that should be fun. Plus, Jamie sits in front of me and he\\'s so hot. I mean....he\\'s a complete jerk but he\\'s still hot.   Third hour, I have gym again. good times. I\\'m taking basketball....bleh. The last time I really played basketball, I got a concussion and ended up in the emergency room but, it\\'s not bad because at least I\\'m in gym with Matthew and Chris and stuff. I don\\'t really talk to Chris much during gym though. I think he wants to hang out with his senior friends haha. Oh well. We played knockout all day today. It was fun. I even won! YaY!   Then I have French again. Whoo. Good times, good times. Not much is different in there from last semester. Ari sits in front of me now though so we get to talk and stuff. And I\\'m sitting next to Katy, my only junior friend in the class. :) I also found out I got like...a 94 on the final for last semester without studying. YaY.  Fifth hour is psychology. I\\'m really really excited to be taking that class. Like...tremendously excited. It\\'s funny though because Dave Kaiser\\'s in my class....heh heh. That should be interesting. He\\'s also in my gym class. So, three periods out of my day, I\\'m with Dave. Is that not incredibly scary? Anyway, we took the final for the class today. She wanted to see how much we knew before we get into stuff. We did these interview things for the past two days where we interviewed another person, then introduced them to the class. This one kid...oh dear. He sits across from me on the other side of the room and the person that interviewed him was telling us about how the kid had been arrested 9 times. 9 TIMES! He\\'s only at most 18. He\\'\\'s been charged with 7 counts of battery and 2 of assault. Oh, he\\'s a boxer too so....that\\'s always helpful when you\\'re being charged with battery and assault. I was just like, \"Note to self: Don\\'t make big angry boxing kid mad.\"  Then Sixth hour is lunch. I have it with a lot of cool people so that should be fun.   Then weighted essay writing....ughhhh. Drive a fork into my eye. Please. I just know I\\'m going to hate that class with a deep burning passion that eats away at the soul. Ohh well. At least Bryan\\'s in it with me so I can wine to him. Plus, Todd\\'s in that class too and then he\\'s in my math class last hour so we complain together when we get to math. Haha. Good times.  Then, obviously as previously mentioned, I have math with Mr. Danbom. I think that\\'ll be fun. He seems like a cool/nice guy.   And that\\'s my schedule. Whoo. I hope this semester goes well. I can\\'t believe this is the second half of junior year already. That seems insane. I\\'ll be a senior next year....creepy.  I guess I might go work on homework now. OK, probably not. I\\'ll probably go read but it\\'s ok. Reading is....sort of educational....

It took like...a fricking week to plan this whole thing and then it didn't even end up working out. OK...so, it was more like two or three days but still, it seemed like a week.

Not cool at all.  honestly, not a lot of interest has been going on recently. Winter was awesome though. It was a ton of fun. I was worried it'd be awkward but it wasn't at all. Fun fun times.

Like, everything makes  completely logical sense in my head and then...I can't do what I tell myself to do. Grrrr! Og well, I'm done for tonight. I'm sorry I haven't been writing.

Sometimes I walk alone at night When everybody else is sleeping I think of him and I'm happy With the company I'm keeping The city goes to bed And I can live inside my head  On my own Pretending he's beside me All alone I walk with him till morning Without him I feel his arms around me And when I lose my way I close my eyes And he has found me  In the rain the pavement shines like silver All the lights are misty in the river In the darkness, The trees are full of starlight And all I see is him and me Forever and forever...\"], '05,April,2004': [\"I'll write more later but...for right now, all i have to say is...WEIGHTED ESSAY WRITING SUCKS!!!\"], '04,April,2004': [\"So, it was really really weird.

The ACT\\'s weren\\'t as bad as I thought they were going to be but they did make me think a little. The PSAE\\'s were a joke. The math section actually insulted my intelligence or lack thereof. If boxes of envelopes cost .09 cents each and you buy 12 boxes, how much do you spend?  And whats funny is that that was the longer of the two tests.

She\\'s going through that stage where she\\'s like, \"I\\'m not getting what I want so I think I\\'ll scream.\" I was just like, nuh uh, you\\'re not playing that game with me sweetie. I know you and your games. I WAS you. I know your tricks. And then there\\'s Joey who\\'s...really a very nice kid. He\\'s 6 so he\\'s a little less difficult to take care of. He can kind of handle things more on his own. It wasn\\'t too bad I guess but...I don\\'t know, it was stressful. Plus, they have a nine month old puppy who\\'s teething. Gah. That was sort of annoying. Oh well, At least I made some money.   I think Jewel is, A. slowly killing me or, B. slowly taking away my soul. I want to quit so much but something\\'s keeping me from doing it. And one of my many, many bosses, Sharon is an extreme...erm.....bitter woman.

Anyway, now that I\\'m done with the unpleasant part of the evening, it was actually pretty fun with Nathan. I was surprised. He even danced. It was funny. Half of what he said was, \"what?\" though.

And here is my funny little prom story...well, I think it\\'s funny...  So, oh wait, I have two...  First, the saltines which probably wont seem funny to anyone but the people in my group. So, we\\'re sitting there starving, (we were literally the first people there) and we see saltines on the table and so we\\'re all eating these saltines and we ran out, and we\\'re just like...\"damnit...we need more saltines.\" So, we first plot to steal some from the other tables but we were afraid that while we were stealing them, somebody would be walking to that table. So, the waiter walks by and Nathan just, all of a sudden goes, \"Hey, can we please have some more saltines?\" The guy gave us the WEIRDEST look ever. It was so funny. Then, he brought us back like...so many packages of saltines. Ir was awesome. OK, now the even better story.  When we got to our table we were looking around and looking at the table and stuff and I was like, \"Wow, these are nice plates. We should pillage them.\" But, we figured out they were too big to hide so Nathan\\'s like, \"Ok, we\\'ll steal the forks.\" And so, he takes one of the forks and sticks it in his tux jacket pocket on the inside and I THOUGHT he put it back, only to have this conversation at the end of the night...  Nathan: Here. Keep this as a memento.   And then, he just pulls the fork out of his pocket and hands it to me.  Me: You took the fork?!?!?! I thought you put it back!  Nathan: They WANT you to take the silverware...  Hahaha. So, now I have a fork from Drury Lane. :) Nice memory to have.   This morning was so painful though. I woke up at 8:30 to go to work and, ugh. It was so painful. Oh well. I think I\\'m going to go sleep now. I\\'m super tired.  Sorry for the bummer of an opener to this.'], '28,May,2004': [\"Wow, what a nice end to such a stressful week.

That's pretty cool I guess but it just added to the stress. THEN, last night we had our concert, which was like...three hours long. We didn't play very well either. My brother came and I was so super surprised. I wish he would have come to a concert with songs I like though. Oh well. Such is life. Then, today, I slept in and my mom let me go in after first hour since first hour is just band and we weren't doing anything anyway. It was nice. However, I had a bunch of tests today and I have my psych final on Tuesday. Eek. I have to get an A on it to get an A in the class. I'm stressed. Hah. Oh well. Summer is almost here. YaY!  So, tonight. Well, actually...I'll start with this afternoon. This afternoon SUCKED. Marching rehearsal was so bad. I don't even know what I'm going to do next year.

It was crazy. We had like...a whole row. Haha. Shrek 2 was really funny too. I didn't think it was a kids movie at all though. It didn't seem like little kids would enjoy it. I guess they'd enjoy it for the animation and whatnot, but I can't see little kids understanding half the jokes in that movie. Then, we all went to Tom's house. Holy cow, his house is HUGE. There's a ton of land too and he has this ginormous barn. Oh man. Coolest place ever. We played ghost in the graveyard! I haven't played that in FOREVER! Then we made some prank calls, haha, not really pranks since they knew who we were but it was still funny nonetheless. Then we played like...6th grade Truth or Dare. It was hilarious.

Probably UIC, DePaul, Loyola, or Northwestern. We shall see, we shall see. I'm already getting excited for college. Mostly, I guess, I'm excited to get away from my high school. I don't know.

Except for gym but...I\\'ll get to that. My French final wasn\\'t too bad at all. the oral (shut up you sick pervs) part was a lot easier than I expected, but there were some parts to the regular part that were more difficult than I expected. Oh well. I\\'ll just hope I did well. Anyway, gym was bad because right before I had to do my final routine for gymnastics, I got this AWFUL stomach ache. It was terrible. Like, I was doubled over in pain. Oh man. I shudder just to think of it. I did the routine though. I was tough. RAR!!!! TAKE THAT GYMNASTICS ROUTINE!! OK, I\\'m done, really.   Just a side note though. Don\\'t you hate it when you aren\\'t paying attention to what\\'s being written and somehow your caps lock gets pressed and you start writing in caps and you don\\'t relize it for a long time and you have to go back and change everything. Grrr caps lock. But yeah, after gymnastics, I went home and took a small nap. That was nice. It was only like...half an hour but it was BEAUTIFUL!

I\\'m really sorry but...we\\'re going to the Noodles in Bollingbrook.\" AHHHH! Haha. It was ok though. I just drove home. Then MC, Kel, and I all went to Noodles and it was super. Yum yum. Sexist soy sauce was there...hah. It never gets old to Kelly. She\\'s so funny. Silly child. It was good seeing them though. I haven\\'t seen them in a few days.   Tomorrow, I have my lunch final. That\\'s gonna be a tricky one. I\\'m going to see if I can sleep through it...in my bed, at home. :) Then, I have math. Good times?

Then, Kristen, Matthew, and I left to go to Steak N' Shake to get some shakes. We also brought back some for Chris and Emily. Good times. Then after graduation, I just hung out with Chris and Kristen for a bit.   Yesterday, hm....I went to a few graduation parties. Less than I expected but, I couldn't get to the other few I was supposed to go to. I went to Brandon's with Allyce. That was fun. Alstadt and silder showed up. I was surprised, but I guess they were showing up at all the graduation parties. Then, Anna showed up and I went with her to Peter's party and I was there for a while waiting for Chris because I was supposed to meet up with him before going to Matt's. Ashley came to Peter's! I was so happy to see her. We're going to hang out this summer and she invited me to her graduation party. She's so nice. :) I miss having classes with her. But, yeah, it was fun. Then, I went to Matt's with Chris and that was pretty funny. There were some people there I didn't really know but...eh. It's ok. Then, Chris, Bryan and I just hung out. It was cool. Fun times.

These blog thingies have gone rampant. Lock your children away! The blogs come to attack at midnight...  I\\'m fine. I swear. Well, fine in my definition. Really. Let me just sing a little song. A love song...heh....  I know the pieces fit cuz I watched them fall away Mildewed and smoldering. Fundamental differing. Pure intention juxtaposed will set two lovers souls in motion Disintegrating as it goes testing our communication The light that fueled our fire then has burned a hole between us so We cannot see to reach an end crippling our communication.  I know the pieces fit cuz I watched them tumble down No fault, none to blame it doesn\\'t mean I don\\'t desire to Point the finger, blame the other, watch the temple topple over. To bring the pieces back together, rediscover communication  The poetry that comes from the squaring off between, And the circling is worth it. Finding beauty in the dissonance.  There was a time that the pieces fit, but I watched them fall away. Mildewed and smoldering, strangled by our coveting I\\'ve done the math enough to know the dangers of our second guessing Doomed to crumble unless we grow, and strengthen our communication.  Cold silence has a tendency to atrophy any Sense of compassion Between supposed lovers/brothers  I have more. Yes, I know. \"She has more after she\\'s put the song lyrics in? What\\'s wrong with her? That\\'s not the way things are done.\" Perhaps deviating from my usual abyss of normalcy will add excitement to life. Hah. Sad though, changing my blog pattern brings me happiness... Did I really reach the high point of my life at eight when my brother chopped off Mermaid Barbie\\'s head with the little guullotine he made for history class? Ah, that does bring back happy memories though. Anyway, that really wasn\\'t my point for continuing my entry although, it does lead nicely into my next point. I was thinking...it\\'d really depress me if life really were like a box of chocolates. Chocolates are a perfunctory gift that people give to people when they don\\'t know what else to give them. Guys give them to girls. Acquaintances give them to aqcuaintances. Businesses give them to their employees for a great five years with the company...if you can get to that without being laid off. I think if someone can manage to stay with a company for five years without a. killing themselves, b. getting laid off or, c. comitting a felony, they should at least get some waterford out of it. And, back to my original point, which was what you ask? I really don\\'t know. I\\'m sure I\\'ll figure it out though so, stick with me. Even if you love chocolates, when you finish, what are you left with? A sticky empty box with the lingering smell of a delicious indulgance? The chocolates were probably mindlessly wolfed down anyway. Sure, once in a while you get one filled with cherry (if you like cherry) or one filled with peanut butter but the taste is fleeting and the memory is soon forgotten. So, really, I\\'m not sure what my point is and even if I did, it\\'s not as fun as listening to people tell me what my point is.   And all of this because a friend\\'s blog said people only write about the silly stuff. The little pieces of nuts in the chocolates of life. Well, I\\'m sure I shall continue writing about the nuts but, it\\'s nice to confuse people once in a while. Peace, love, and good luck Forrest Gump with your chocolate filled life.'], '15,June,2004': [\"I've decided trying to do a comments thing for this page is far too difficult to figure out at 11:55 at night.

However, here I am....writing....to you, the beautiful people that read my blog. *Crickets chirp*.....Well....ok, maybe to the beautiful  person  who reads my blog. Hi beautiful person.   Anyway, first of all, I'd like to say thank you to Joanne for your lovely comment and Mary Clare. I love the few comments I get. I suppose a few worthwhile comments is worth far more than a bunch of comments that don't mean anything. And thank you to the person I don't really know who leaves fascinating comments here. I enjoy them. I do intend to go buy my shoes later. :) And, I'm going to love them.   Last night was great. Really fantastic. You know those experiences you have that really make you appreciate what you have and your life and how wonderful things are....even if it just lasts a day, it still happenes and last night was definitely one of those nights. It was amazing how many people were there. I didn't realize how tough it would be for me though. The Luminaria ceremony was really, really difficult for me. I just kind of separated from my friends, walked by myself, and...well...cried my eyes out. I don't know if they noticed but I think they did. I think they also sensed I just needed to be left alone for a bit. That's the great thing about having best friends that know you really well. They know when to just let you be. So, I cried, a lot. It was the first time in a long time that I really let myself think of my grandma. I just kept looking up at the stars thinking, I hope she sees me doing this and is proud of me. She used to be someone I'd love to impress. Not to say I was doing the walk to impress anyone. I guess the only person I'd want to impress with it would be her.   So, after I had a good cry which, rarely, rarely happens with me I finished walking with my friends for the reast of the Luminaria ceremony. It just felt great to be alive and have terrific friends and...it felt good. That was the only time I cried all night though. I kept myself from crying a lot. I almost did when Audrey walked with her mom. She's Rebecca (Kathryn's little sister's) friend. She had cancer too. I think she was the youngest survivor there. It made me really happy to see them do the survivor walk together and to see Audrey and her mom cry. I gave my mom a giant hug when I got home today. It felt really, really good. I mean, I hug my mother on a daily basis but, sometimes...certain hugs mean more than others.   And today, I think I'm going to go get maybe an hour of sleep and then...it's off to trumpet sectionals. Three hours. Sigh. That's unfortunate but, it wont be too bad. I'll make it. Maybe I'll go get some caffienated beverage. Wow, I just checked my spelling on caffienated and I spelled it correctly the first time. That's amazing. I usually have a lot of trouble with that word. Anyway, this turned into a much, much longer entry than expected. I think I'll write about the funny aspects of the evening later.

Today's been one crazy, crazy day. I went to summer school as usual and that was fun. YaY? Then, I went for my first day of work at Marianjoy and it was really...truly exciting. I've never felt more...right doing something than I did there. I got a chance to work with a bunch of kids today. Three with austism and actually, not a kid, a woman, with cerebral palsy. It was just amazing because the first boy I got to work with was five years old and he has a less severe form of autism and so it was almost like being with a regular five year old, but when we went into group time with this one other kid, the first boy had a lot of trouble communicating. He didn't like the other little boy who was about two. He wouldn't play with him or anything. It was a huge breakthrough supposedly that we got him to play cars with the younger boy. And, the older boy was helping the younger boy with speech, because that's what the younger boy's autism did to him. It affected his speech. It was just great to see him communicating. Then, the cerebral palsy patient, I didn't get to help much with, just observe. They put a new cast on her arm so she could start to move it better after the cast was off. Then, the last kidhad a pretty severe form of autism. We just had fun with him and played with him.   It was funny though. I don't think I've ever seen people look so happy as the kids in that room do. I was amazed that kids battling autism and severe dysfunctions could remain happy through the therapy and through their difficult life. It made me realize how much I should appreciate the little things. I walked out of there just being thankful I could actually walk out of there. I really felt like I was helping them too. I think I've at least found what I want to do sort of. My feeling that I want to do something that helps people has definitely been solidified. I mean, even if they weren't having breakthroughs like the first  and second boy...it was just nice to see them having fun away from their normally stress filled days. These kids have more stressful days than I've probably ever had in my entire life and it's like that every day. Every single day. And yet...they still remain happy. I'm just absolutely amazed.   The rest of my day was very nice too. I went to Tom's and watched possibly the worst movie EVER.

Somewhere over the  r  a  i  n  b  o  w  Way up high There's a land that I heard of Once in a lullaby  Somewhere over the  r a i n b o w        Skies are  blue  There, the dreams that you dare to dream Really do come true  Some day I'll wish upon a  *star*  and wake up where the clowds are far behind me Where troubles melt like  lemon drops  Way above the chimney tops That's where you'll find me  Somewhere over the  r a i n b o w         Bluebirds  fly Birds fly over the  r a i n b o w        Why then, oh why can't I?  If happy little  bluebirds  fly Beyond the  r a i n b o w         Why, oh why, can't I?     It's been a rollercoaster of a night. Ah, the typical teenage psyche rears it's ugly head.\"], '04,August,2004': [\"I really need to start writing more. I mean, it's summer. I'm supposed to have more time to write and stuff and yet...I don't. I have almost no free time. The free time I do have, I use to eat and sleep. Heh. Good use of free time I suppose.  Then again, sometimes I get the eating thing done while I'm busy.  Busy day tomorrow. Eye doctor, lesson, getting my hair done, and taking my mom to the doctor...followed by the band pre-camp thing. Mike Klos brought up an amazingly eye-opening point. Our first performance is in three weeks. THREE! Un fricking believable...  Another thing just occurred to me thanks to Chris. Only one more week I'll be able to see him and he'll be gone. So will Peter. Two of my best friends in the world. Gone. I just don't know what to think. Time has snuck up on me so fast this summer.  It's just slipping away so fast and Brandon will be home already on Tuesday...  I'm so excited to see him. I really, really miss him. I'm glad he isn't going away this year.  South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut was good though...heh, that's my lighter note....  I wish things had been a little better between me and Chris this summer, but things change with friends, and I don't think we'll stop being friends really. I just kind of wish he could have gone away and we could have been even close to as close as we were before.  I need to stop thinking. I need to sleep. I need to take my brain out and let all the bad stuff get hammered out...  Good night.\"], '03,August,2004': [\"Good things.  Joanney comes home in two days!!! I went bowling with my friends last night and it was super fun. Hm....my hair smells good right now?   Bad things I wont be home at all the day Joanne comes home I royally sucked at bowling last night. Like...the worst I've bowled since I was six! I'm super hungry and just too lazy to go get food I have that freshman/section leader pre-camp thing tonight. BUMMER TO THE EXTREME MAX!    I guess I could go stop being lazy and get myself some food.\"], '02,August,2004': [\"There are constant reminders about random acts of kindness, but the human race just isn't ready to fulfill world peace. I think that's a somewhat arbitrary phrase anyway.  I don't honestly think it's possible to achieve world peace. I think it's a great goal to aspire to if it helps, but I'd rather aspire to the goal of just trying to do something nice for someone every day. If everyone did that, yeah, maybe we wouldn't achieve world peace, but we'd be a lot closer.  And, I'm not really sure where that thought comes from. i just started typing, and that's what came out of my little fingers.  Last night was so much fun. I was absolutely taken away by the corps. I'm so glad Carson invited me. It was terrific to hang out with her and great to see all the corps. It was funny. One of them played Savannah River Holiday. I sat there for a few minutes trying to figure out why I recognized the song. It was pretty amusing. I was like...wow, I know what's coming up in this song!  As of today, no plans yet. It just feels good to sleep in on occasion now because there isn't any summer school.  The DCI show last night actually made me sort of excited for marching band. However, I know everyone wont feel as excited and pumped up so, I know not everyone will try as hard. That's the way it is every year. Especially since this year is a Disney year, there are of course people who join just for Disney. So, those people wont care about the show aspect so much, but...I'm still going to give it my all.\"], '01,August,2004': [\"Babysitting yesterday wasn't all that bad. Nine hours of three little kids and a puppy. It could have been a lot worse, but I made lots of money. :) Excellent. Plus, people called Pierre and talked to me. That was fun.  I'm so excited for the Cavies show tonight with Carson. Carson and I have much to talk about still. YaY for Cavies and Carson. I just know it will be a fun evening.\"]}\n"
