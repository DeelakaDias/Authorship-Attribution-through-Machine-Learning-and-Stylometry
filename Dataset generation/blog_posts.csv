"Well, everyone got up and going this morning.  It's still raining, but that's okay with me.  Sort of suits my mood.  I could easily have stayed home in bed with my book and the cats.  This has been a lot of rain though!  People have wet basements, there are lakes where there should be golf courses and fields, everything is green, green, green.  But, it is supposed to be 26 degrees by Friday, so we'll be dealing with mosquitos next week.  I heard Winnipeg described as an ""Old Testament"" city on  urlLink CBC Radio One  last week and it sort of rings true.  Floods, infestations, etc., etc..",1
"My four-year old never stops talking.  She'll say ""Mom?"" and when I say ""Yes?"", she'll say ""Ummm.... ummm... oh yeah.  Where do lady bugs hide in the rain?""  Anything to hear her own voice. Very, very exhausting.    Now I remember!  This is why I go to work!   *Sigh*",1
"Actually it's not raining yet, but I bought 15 tickets to the  urlLink Goldeyes  game for my Mom's birthday tonight, and it is supposed to rain.  Do they cancel baseball games because of rain?  Although the ballpark is beautiful, it ain't the  urlLink SkyDome .  We used to go to the Jays games occassionally when we lived in Toronto and really like taking the kids to the Goldeyes games now.  I don't know what  urlLink Blue Jays  tickets cost now, but I'm sure it's cheaper here in Winnipeg.  Oh, I just checked and it  definitely  is!",1
"Ha! Just set up my RSS feed - that is so easy!  Why doesn't everyone do it?  Enough for today.  The sun is shining and I should be outside planting my poor flowers (that have spent far too long in their pots) but I have 3 kindergartners and a preschooler who are refusing to go outside.  Little gameboy junkies...  I should talk!  Last post today, I promise.",1
"Oh, which just reminded me, we were talking about canning food at coffee break this morning.  Is this becoming a lost art?  Are there any people under 40 who know how to do this?  Those of us at coffee that fall in that age range couldn't.  What would happen if the world as we know it ceased to exist (a la  urlLink Day After Tomorrow  which is only being released today and I can't wait to see - I love a good escapist picture with lots of special effects) and we had to preserve our food somehow?  Well, we in Canada definitely would need to preserve our food.  I found lots of sites on canning, including  urlLink this one , but I guess that wouldn't help me much if everything went. Better print it out and keep it just in case!",1
"I've tried starting blog after blog and it just never feels right.  Then I read today that it feels strange to most people, but the more you do it the better it gets (hmm, sounds suspiciously like something else!) so I decided to give it another try.    My husband bought me a notepad at  urlLink McNally  (the best bookstore in Western Canada) with that title and a picture of a 50s housewife grinning desperately.  Each page has something funny like ""New curtains!  Hurrah!"".  For some reason it struck me as absolutely hilarious and has stuck in my head ever since.  What were those women thinking?",1
"My 20th high school  urlLink reunion  is this weekend.  There are over 100 people coming, so it should be a good time.  Lots of names from the past.  Funny, I barely ever run into anyone, and yet a lot are still in the city.",1
"We always have pizza on Friday nights.  It takes the stress out of ""what am I going to make for dinner"" and the kids look forward to it.  In fact, many of their friends look forward to it too!  But tonight we are having a family gathering at my mom's and I've offered to make pizza for all the kids.  So I've been madly making dough in my breadmaker (which is very easy but still needs to be done) and freezing it.  Now I have to go home and cut vegetables for the vegetarian cousins' pizzas and grate a huge amount of cheese.  Then I'll have to cart it all over to my mom's without wrecking the crusts.   It is not the usual relaxing Friday night, but this hasn't been a relaxed week at all.",1
"Okay, I saw it this past weekend.  Not as good as Independence Day for sure.  Better than Raising Helen which I also saw.  Yes, two movies in one weekend!  One was with book club, and one was with my husband since we hadn't been out together forever.  Guess which was with whom...",1
"I've been cataloguing film scripts at work.  What fun!  I have to look a lot of the writers up on the  urlLink IMDB .  What a great database!  I read somewhere that there were lots of mistakes in there, but given the absolutely huge amount of information, it is bound to happen.  And everything links!  I love it.  Library catalogues should be so good.    Best of all is getting a little sneak peek into people's lives.  Just enough to get your imagination going...",1
"Paul Martin promised today that if he is elected he will create 250,000 new affordable child care spaces.  I think they promised something like that last time around too.  But if they really want to do something for working women, they should make it easier for women to work and be with their families.  An affordable child care space would be helpful, but I want to spend more time with my children, so I need more flexible working arrangements.  Instead of a year's maternity leave, what if they made it mandatory for employers to allow women five years of part-time work.  If we worked at least 50% they should have to hold our jobs for us.  I think that would appeal to a lot of moms.  And then there would be a lot of part-time child care spaces too, which are  impossible  to find right now.    Yes, I'm still pondering quitting my job.  It seems to me to be ineveitable now... just a question of when.",1
"No, I still haven't seen it, but apparently it is  urlLink not so good   unless  you are a librarian.  Ha!  I am!",1
"Well, it's over!  It was good to see so many people.  Most haven't changed much, but some have changed a great deal.  Funny how things that were important in high school no longer are.    Anyway, it is over and I'm glad.  I was very, very tired all week and am glad that I had 4 days off to snooze a bit.",1
"The astute among you will note that this run is a minute shorter than the 5th one.  This run was three minutes running, one minute walking--which is much harder than the previous run-walk ratio.  I was feeling good until the 4th repetition, which was difficult, and I really struggled through the 5th one.  Tonight I noticed a very odd sensation.  While I was happy to take the little walking breaks, I found that the moment I started running again after each break my legs felt really invigorated.  I'm sure there's some clever scientific name for this phenomenon.  However, I'm also sure there's  no  clever scientific name for the fact that I'm really, really glad tonight's run is over.",2
"So the pressing question was whether I should increase my total running time or decrease my walking time.  Since the schedule I'm following says to increase running time, I decided to do that.  They're the experts, after all--I'm just the one in the expensive shoes.  While today didn't exactly feel what I would call ""good,"" it didn't feel bad either.  Actually, after my third repetition I felt like a million bucks; after my fourth, I flagged a bit.  But I made it through to my 7th repetition without feeling like my lungs were inside out.  I probably could have done 8 repetitions, if the truth be told, but I'm sure I'll regret saying that on Wednesday.  Jon has just decided to go on a health kick too; he says that he's going to join me in running.  I think I might be a little bit too slow for him.  Today I definitely felt like a jogger rather than a runner--I think it has to do with the massive amount of crap (chocolate syrup, ice cream, crisps, pizza, etc.) I've been eating over the past couple of days.",2
"I can assure you that it was not laughably easy.  It wasn't as hard as last time, but it still felt pretty painful.  I didn't start thinking I was going. to. die. until the 4th repetition, at which point I again told myself that I was only going to do 5 repetitions.  I even had all sorts of excuses figured out: I was running at midday in the sun; I was running in the park on uneven ground, I was feeling vaguely hung-over.  But in the end it was the thought of coming here and writing down the fact that I had wussed out that made me do the 6th repetition.  Now I have the reward of a hot bath.",2
"Tonight I decided to decrease the walking time between the periods of running.  I did 2 minutes on, one minute off, repeated 6 times.  After the first 2 repetitions, I felt like I was going. to. die.  But the middle two were fine; I was on top of the world.  I considered only doing 5 repetitions, but when I finished the 5th, I was further away from my house than I expected, so I slogged on to a 6th.  The 6th repetition was a real struggle.  I was literally forcing myself to put one foot in front of the other.  The knowledge of a hot bath was the only thing that kept me going.  Then I had to run past my house to finish out the time.  Psychologically, I found that upsetting.  I also find the people on the sidewalks upsetting.  I have this paranoid fantasy that all people who see me running are runners themselves, and they're critiquing me.  When I'm feeling slow and down, I find that forcing myself into a sprint helps me get past it.  Even though I'm not a fast runner by any means, I prefer to run at speed rather than to jog.  I'm not sure if this was a struggle because I didn't run for over a week, or if it was because it was genuinely more difficult than my last run.  Anyway, I'm sure I'll laugh at myself on Saturday when I go out and do the same run again and I find it laughably easy.",2
"I spent a long weekend in Edinburgh, doing more walking around than usual, but not doing any running.  In the meantime, however, my knee felt fantastic.  After the ACL surgery I lost most of my muscle tone, which meant that my kneecap wasn't tracking properly, which led to some clicking and aching when walking, especially when walking down steps.  Now, after only two runs, I can feel a real difference in the way my knee feels when going down stairs.  It's almost normal, which is something I don't take for granted.",2
"Tonight I did the 2 minutes running, 2 minutes walking deal (repeated 4 times), which is the recommended first run for 10 training according to the schedule I've decided to use.  I have to admit that it was far too easy.  I came in the house having not even broken a sweat.  Because it was so easy, I'm not sure whether to increase the overall time out or decrease the in-between walking times.  There seem to be definite advantages and disadvantages to both.",2
"My initial plan was to start on a basic 10k training schedule,  urlLink as described here .  However, tonight--my first night out--was still a little bit of a tester, so I ran for 1 minute, walked for 1 minute, and repeated that 6 times.  It was reasonably hard work, but it wasn't anything scary, and my knee felt fine.  I feel that I am ready to move onto the proper 10k training schedule.",2
"Whoever reads this (if there is anyone) might think I'm not taking this running thing very seriously.  I am, believe me, but you have to understand that the past few weeks and the next few weeks are full up.  There are plenty of nights where I get 5 hours of sleep because I'm busy doing things I must do (and there's precious little reading or watching TV going on), then the next day I'm shattered because I only got 5 hours of sleep.  Fitting in half an hour of running, while technically feasible, is not always an incredibly attractive option.  Cycling, however, is a happy medium.  But I have been afraid to cycle recently for two reasons:  1) Last October, running + cycling really made my knee hurt.  Running was ok, but cycling actually caused my knee to react so badly that I couldn't run anymore.  2) My chain is rusty.  I've been running (if you can call it that) for a few weeks with no bad reaction from my knee at all, so I thought tonight I would give cycling a go.  On closer inspection my chain wasn't too bad (though I probably should replace it), so I braved it.  Because I haven't cycled in a while and I was worried that either my knee or my chain would break, I didn't go too far afield, and only did half an hour.  It's not particularly hard work for me, even on the hardest gears, and it's an excellent opportunity to make my left leg work harder (because I would estimate that my left leg is only about 80% as strong as my right leg now).  We shall see how my knee reacts, but I'll probably be cycling more if it's ok.",2
"I'm amazed that, even being so lazy as to go out only once a week for the past couple of weeks, I've managed to improve each week.  Today I ran for 7 minutes, walked for 2, ran for 4, walked for 2, and ran for 7.  That's what 7 (2) 4 (2) 7 means in the subject line.  I think that makes more sense than trying to reckon up the fraction each time.  I mean, really.  What was I thinking?  So tonight was eventful.  I didn't mention it in my last post, but last week someone actually  stopped me to ask for directions  while I was running--while there were  other people  around.  I wrote it off to the absurdity that is present in everyday society, but today, as I ran towards an elderly man who was carrying his dog, he asked me, ""Are you jogging?""  Of course I am!  Do I look like I'm, for example, fishing?  Could the direction-asker and the elderly man really not tell?  Do I just look like I'm going for a leisurely stroll?  Then, as I was running along on the sidewalk next to the park, a snivelling brat kicked his football at me, hard.  I don't think he appreciated it when I called him a ""little prick.""  But he was.  I hope he falls out of a tree and breaks his ankle in three places.  I now have comments, so if you feel the need to tell me what a heartless, child-hating bitch I am, please feel free.  I like these new Blogger templates; they're pretty.",2
"I know, it was a week.  I am trying.  (""You can say that again, ha ha!"")  (Ahh, do you see what I did there?: I used the word ""trying"" as a verb, and then pretended that someone else implied that it was used as an adjective.  Ahhhh!)  Anyway, so when I went out, I said to myself, ""Self, why not just run until you really feel like you have to stop, instead of adhering rigidly to this schedule?""  So I did.  And I ran for 6 minutes.  Now, I wasn't really all that tired after 6 minutes (compared to the last 6 minutes I did, anyway).  It's not my legs that complain, and I don't get cramps in my sides or anything.  The main problem that makes me have to stop is my chest/lungs aching.  I've always been this way and thought it was normal, but  urlLink this page says it's not .  Hmmm.  So I had to walk for 2 minutes until my lungs stopped aching, then I did 4 minutes running again, then 2 minutes walking, then the final 6 minutes running.  If you're thinking that a full 20 minutes of running shouldn't be that hard to achieve, remember that I've been totally,  totally  inactive for a year.",2
"I think that running is akin to childbirth in some respects (not that I've ever given birth): while you're doing it, it's painful and terrible and you can't imagine ever doing it again, not in a million years, and you curse the bastard that got you into it in the first place (in running's case, yourself).  But then it's over, and you have a shower, and you sit down to blog about it, and it feels great.  Running, that is.  My analogy ended in the first paragraph.  You weren't still trying to make it work for this one, were you?  Anyway, I didn't do myself any favors by not running for nearly a week.  In case you're curious, a combination of factors including illness, DIY-mania, and heavy rain contributed to my sloth.  Tonight I went out thinking, ""Do I really have to bother with the run-walk nonsense?  Can't I just run out for 10 minutes, then run back for 10 minutes?""  The answer is no.  I did the same run as before, and by the end of the second repetition I looked over at my house (which faces the park) and seriously considered running home right then, jumping the fence, and going in the back door.  Then I remembered that my back door was locked (safety first, kids!) and that in order to get home I'd have to go back the way I came, round the corner, and down the road again.  And by the time I thought of all the logistics, my repetition was over.  Later, something funny happened on my 4th repetition: I started running, and suddenly the 3 minutes was over, just like that.  I thought I must have shortchanged myself or read my watch wrong, but no: it just went like a hot knife through butter.  Mmmm, butter.  Ahh, that's the other thing.  I haven't had much food today, which might have contributed to my near crash early in the run.  I tried to eat a toasted bacon and guacamole sandwich for lunch, but someone really needs to tell the ladies in the canteen that guacamole should only be served ice cold.  Hot guacamole is nastified.  Oh well, at least there were pink wafers in the tea room.",2
"I haven't just dropped off the face of the earth.  I went on holiday to the US, where it would be almost rude to exercise.  I'm back now, and as soon as I'm over my jetlag I'll be back in the saddle/running shoes.",2

"No practice, off to work on the chem project.    From College Humor   Tennagers guide to picking a AIM screen name  Whether you're sending e-mails or chatting with friends, an essential to using the internet is having a screen name that tells people who you are. Here are some suggestions to help you pick out an awesome name!   AE or AF - Use these acronyms for American Eagle and Abercrombie and Fitch. This will show people that you have rich parents and therefore, you are rich as well. And everyone knows that if you are rich and wear Abercrombie and Fitch, then you are very attractive.   Examples: AE_girl04, AF_snowboard19   420 - Putting 420 after a screen name will show people that you are rebellious and are cool because you do drugs. They won't ever mess with you, and girls will flock to you because you are bad.   Examples: Sublimegirl420, sk8er420   69 - This shows that you obviously have sex, A LOT. Others that see this will want to have sex with you because you know all about it.   Examples: Sexystud69, badazz6969   666 - Use this to scare away people. They will see how mighty and evil you are, and they will fallback in fear.   Examples: Death666, NeoMatrix666  ""chic"" - Guys are very attracted to girls who but ""chic"" somewhere in their screen name. This shows you are hot and want to have a boyfriend who likes to play computer games all day and collect Star Wars toys.   Example: tightchic13f, cute_chic02   ""sexy"" - Guys go crazy when you put on this screen name. It says ""I'm a really attractive girl that wants to have sex with a guy I meet online."" You can be uglier than Chelsea Clinton, but with this on your SN, you'll come across as Brittany Spears.   Examples: Sexy18f, Sexyskatergirl   ""gurl"" - Using ""gurl"" in your screen name shows that you are the cute girl that lives next door type. It makes you sound very nice, but also a target of weird 40-year old sexual predators.   Examples: fun_gurl_2003, pony_gurl82   ""horny"" - This shows that you are a 40-year old sexual predator that wants to find a young boy or girl to lure in and abduct at the local mall.   Examples: Horny_babe_696969, Horny4u",4
"Well it didn't rain like Clingerman said it did, so i'm gonna go see if people are playing out at Tabor, hopefully so, but i doubt it.   I am DEFINATELY finishing my chem project today then i'm set to start my around the world paper. Wow I hate school.",4

Basically I when I was a young and ignorant youth I liked Bush, yeah ok he had a pretty good start, he handled September 11th pretty well, but the economy is pretty bad now a days and this whole WMD thing really is starting to make me question our reason for war (not saying that going into Iraq was bad.) I don't think that he will win the election but I wouldn't be surprised if Bush ""happens"" to find Bin Laden around about September or October, to seal the deal election, but right now it looks like he is in an uphill battle.   Kerry on the other hand seems to have alot more expierience and I like that his is not so much of a cowboy when it comes to foreign policy (not that I really care/know about foreign policy)",4

"http://naucon.net/misc/tests/love_test01.htm  1.  You are attracted to those who are warm and obedience.  2.  In the process of courtship, the approach that would make you     feel irresistable is creative, never let you feel bored.  3.  The impression you would like to give to your lover is loyal,     faithful, never change.  4.  You don't like it when your partner is emotional and/or too     moody; and you don't know how to please him/her.  5.  The kind of relationship you would like to build with your     partner is one that you care not only about the present but     also the future with your partner, a long-lasting relationship     that you can grow with.  6.  You care about the society and morality, you won't do anything     wrong after marriage.  7.  You think of marriage as a precious thing.  Once you get married,     you'll treasure it and your partner very much.  8.  At this moment, you don't have the thirst for love, you can't do     anything for it, you won't fall for it easily.  true true true. ah true",5

"Hello hello hello again. It's lovely to speak to you all. Really. Let's see... seeing as my mother is off at work for another 40 million hours and I have neither A) a license or B) a car (though I have a permit and could easily drive anywhere I wanted to had I my Jeep), I am inherently under house arrest.  'Oh,' you say, 'But it's such a lovely day outside! Why don't you take the dog for a walk, or go for a bike ride, or read a book in the sun?' Well, first off, I will not be taking anyone for a walk because I am just now regaining said gift of movement back myself. Yes, I have begun training for cross country, and it  hurts . Secondly, my dog is quite content to nap, and continue on in a napping way until about 6 o'clock when he will undoubtedly begin to go mad with hunger. Yes, I starve my dog. He never eats. He is bone thin, and can barely survive on the bits and scraps from the garbage left over from the feast last night.  Actually, he is getting rather portly.  We feed him the same two meals a day, it's just that he hasn't gone for any walkies in a bit. I should go throw the ball for him outside. But not now, he's napping. And besides, that much physical exertion after a long and strenuous day of, err, doing stuff, might just kill me. And I have practice tomorrow. Need to preserve my energy, I do. Of course, the scheduled practice was to go swimming. Well, coach calls it swimming, it's really treading water for forty minutes. But it  is  much more fun than drills and sprints, or even a long run. No, though. We can't go swimming. The swimmers are going swimming. Wait a bit, it's not even the swim team. It's... the children! Little children who are afraid of the water and cling to their mother's legs before getting thrown into their cold, wet, doom, only to be met by some overly-perky girl with a long blonde ponytail, enthusiastically encouraging the little kids who are innocently flailing their arms about to ""relax... be one with the water... and blow little bubbles... and..."" So, while some children will become forever aqua-phobic, I and my fellow cross country runners will succumb to the pain and torture that is... the DP weight room. Again, actually not as bad as some workouts. It's just that, well, we did it on Tuesday. And it hurt. A lot. And it smells. A lot. And swimming is just way more fun. Ah well. C'est la vie.  Friday's workout is going to kill me. Sprints. I hate sprints. Sprints are the reason (besides wanting to devote my precious time to the beautiful art that is theatre) I quit track. And not only are we doing sprints, oh no, we are doing sprints  on the BEACH!  Ooh, it just keeps getting better. (Dear reader, you must know that, while I do seem rather sarcastic and cynical, I really do love cross country. Besides the pain, it's a fantastically fab group of people. It's just that it's very easy to complain about. Not that anyone reads this... but I digress). Yes, so, anyway... ah yes. And, on Saturday, whilst everyone is dragging themselves up Gaviota Peak, I, in my Jeep, will be happily driving around in Los Angeles, shopping for back-to-school supplies, writing (in Italian) to  Sig. Cicale  back in Prague (or are they in Italy now?), and maybe taking in a nice leisurely bike ride around the lake.  Oh, and shopping for something to give to Ariel for her grand birthday spectacular that I know she will have in a few weeks. I feel like an old lady around all my DP frieds. Well, all my freshman friends anyway. I was just at Karisa's for her 15th birthday, and Whitney hit 15 in March, Ariel will be on the 16th of August, and Molly - not until January  of next year!  However,  I  shall be happily celebrating my Sweet 16 come November.  A round of huzzahs!, if you will. Well, I suppose I must be going now. I've loads of important people to see and many things that need tending to. Perhaps we shall chat again sometime soon? Baci, ~K",6
"So hello.  I've become so fed up with my other blog that I just need to start a new one. I've littered the other with stupid quizzes and mindless babble. So here I am.

"Live From Ohio, It's Youth Night!     So, the Youth Rally was tonight. I think it was a success. Maybe not. We expected 200 or more kids from different youth groups all throughout Ohio, but only 149 were in attendance. We started with the skit, which I'll get into a little later, then the activity, then we ate, sang discordantly, and had a sermon. The sermon was great, done by a Mr. James Hawkins, future missionary to Spain. The singing was bad and not from the heart, then again we wing it when we do sing at Youth Rallies. The eating was good, and there was a lot of extra pizza and soda, some of which I brought home due to excess amounts. The activity looked complicated and confusing, but luckily, Tim and I didn't have to do it -- instead, we got to make sure others were doing it right. And finally, the skit...  It was genius, or something close to genius. The whole activity was basically a spy thing: aptly named ""Mission Possible,"" I won't explain the rules because they were complicated, but everyone was on a mission using their Bibles to stop sinful things like bitterness and laziness by looking up verses talking about each. Well, the opening skit went like this: I, in a shirt and tie and carrying a briefcase with a cell phone on my belt, started walking down the main aisle of the church. Halfway down the aisle (it's a small church) the phone rang; I answered it, had a one-sided conversation (""Yes, I have received the instructions... yes, we will be rendevouzing at the church tonight..."" etc.), then proceeded to the front of the church. I laid down the briefcase on a table and started a conversation with Tim (who played ""Agent Banks""). Following the few short lines we exchanged, I pulled out a tape, set it in the tape player, and turned it on; one of my teachers then, over the microphone, acted as the tape and explained the mission. She said it would self destruct in ten seconds, so I pulled it out, fumbled it around, dropped it a couple times, then dropped it back into the briefcase. There was a piece of flash paper resting on some foil near the top; I took out a candle lighter and lit it to make it look like an explosion. Then we exchanged two more lines and prayed, and it was over.  At least, that was what was SUPPOSED to happen. And for the most part, it did. But at the part where I was supposed to light the paper, the candle lighter decided that it didn't want to work. So here I am, holding the dumb thing and pressing the button -- click, click, click -- and there was supposed to be a self destruction. Finally it worked, and there was a flash of fire, then we went on.  Next order of business: I hate ProHosting. I set up the YDKJ forum (check the links) on free.prohosting.com, because they offer unlimited bandwidth for no price. Now I get an email saying that they want a one-time $10 membership fee to remove the ads. So I need a credit card and I have to pay $10 once in order to have an ad-less forum. I don't even *want* the ads gone, but I don't have a choice. It's pay or wave goodbye to your account. I'm upset about this, and emailed them saying that they need an option to keep the ads for people that don't want to pay, but the stuck-up woman simply replied ""we've offered free hosting for years. Please continue to support free.prohosting.com."" Grr, it makes me so mad... anyhow, I posted at the forum, asking if somebody with a credit card was willing to contribute through PayPal. No luck so far, though. If I don't get it paid in fourteen days -- well, thirteen, since I got the letter yesterday -- then the account is deactivated. Thirty days, and it's deleted forever. So... what's a guy to do?  Okay, I'm about done for tonight with my ranting and all. I'll post again tomorrow night, same time, same place. Oh, by the way: Priscilla complained to me and whined that I didn't put her into the blog, so I say: Priscilla is a girl. There, I mentioned you! Happiness! Good night.",7
"This Tape will Self-Destruct...     Hello again, friends and strangers. Time to make another page in the chronicle of Blog Blog Blog Blog.  Today was an okay day. I practiced more for the skit at tomorrow's Youth Rally. Tim and I really aren't prepared at all... we got barely any time to practice our lines, and only have a bare understanding of the core of what we're doing. Luckily, we're allowed to improvise, since it's only a short three minute skit. I want it to be a surprise for those who have yet to see it, so I'll post up the results of what happended tomorrow night. It is REALLY cool, and if it wasn't serious, would leave a lot of room for comical mischief. (All those that don't care, say aye.) Anyhow, we have maybe an hour and a half of rehearsal under our belts, so luckily it isn't TOO important, and the job we have to do will be done easily.  Dad picked me up today from school, and we went to my favorite toy store -- Best Buy. I need a new hard drive for my computer, so we took a look at what they had to offer; I expected to walk away with a 60-gig 7200RPM hard drive, but they didn't have any, and even if they did, we found a better deal. For about $20 more (after rebate) I found a 100gb hard drive. As soon as Dad gets paid, he's gonna grab it and bring it over to me. I can't wait. Right now I'm running a 7-gig... the new one will be nearly  fifteen times larger  than what I have. I've had this harddrive since 1997/98 when it came with the computer, and it's about high time I grab a new one. I'm giddy. Now all I need to keep my computer as up-to-date as possible will be a new motherboard and a new processor (400mhz isn't quite sufficient anymore, especially to a multitasker who uses Kazaa, Flash 4, and sometimes RPGMaker2000 at the same time.)  Ben Folds is amazing. I just watched his limited edition live DVD last night for the first time... he completely turned around Song for the Dumped from an upbeat song to a sadder song with a slower tempo and a different tune, plus he added a lot of extra stuff. I've never had the privilege to see Mr. Folds live, but the DVD proves that seeing a life show would be simply awesome. (Army was cool, too, I love the audience interaction.)  That's about all I have to say, so I'll close with this: HUZZAH, FINAL FANTASY X-2! Farewell.",7
"Judgment Day     Today was a day I like to call the Day of Reckoning, or Judgment Day, or Happy Chainsaw Thursday, if you choose. First, foremost, and most important to me,  I passed my Biblical Ethics test today!  I scored a 94%. That had to be the toughest test I've ever taken -- the questions were hard, but, if I failed, I would have basically let my Pastor down, so there was an added sense of urgency. But I didn't fail, I passed! Yeeee!  Otherwise, Kevin was expelled today. The dummy got what was coming to him. Finally, after the supervisors and Pastor have been putting up with his crap for a long time, they dismissed him. A sad thing indeed, but I have no remorse whatsoever for their actions. He promised the school in a formal statement that he wouldn't participate in immoral and un-Christian things. Yet he did anyway. He got so many chances to change himself, and I mean a lot of chances -- even after the Pastor found out that he smokes and after many, many disciplinary efforts, he still got more chances to change. They believed in him, and he threw it all away. What a dummy.  And so I refer to today as ""Judgment Day,"" the day that futures were decided. I kept up the work and devotion to God, and he kept up his wrongful ways and his misbehavior, and now the good Lord made some changes... I passed the test and earned the Pastor's and the supervisors' respect, and he lost it all. Pity...  So... Happy Chainsaw Thursday. I passed, he left. I'm happy, he's in big trouble with his life. The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away; in this case, well, both. But now I have some American History to bother with, so good bye for now -- if there's any new developments, I'll update.",7
"HAHBHN-Day     I'm baaaaaaaaack.  Today's the first day of my real journal-y existence.  Today was, in summary, a happy-angry-happy-bored-happy-nervous day. I went to school. HAPPY! My supervisor was on my case all morning. ANGRY! I learned of my passing of an Algebra test. HAPPY! I went home and did homework. BORED! I went to church. HAPPY! I came home and have to study for a big Biblical Ethics test. NERVOUS!  I'm almost through with the Biblical Ethics course, I finished the eleventh lesson today and will test tomorrow. I'm scared out of my dress shoes. I've learned a lot from the course, though; as much as it took away from my mornings for the past two weeks, it's been real helpful in teaching me how to deal with life and how to live happily. God is spiffy. Anyhow, I have a lot to study, because I do NOT want to fail something like this.  Oh, and Edmund Randolph was in George Washington's cabinet. (Washington decided to save him for later so he stored him in there for safe keeping.) Dumb statement, but that was the main thing I forgot on my American History test today. Jefferson was Secretary of State, Hamilton was Secretary of the Treasury, Knox was Secretary of War, and dumb old Randolph was Attorney General. Why I'm reiterating this, I don't know.  The Youth Rally is coming up this Saturday evening. I can't wait. Other than that, I'm done. Good night, friends!",7

It lets you go insane, something too many people say they are in the first place, but it really lets you go insane. You get a sane-o-meter that goes down when you go insane. Oooo. Lots of fun.  I'm done talking about that. Now let's talk about what I did today. I woke up and went to school. I am exciting. What can I say, I have nothing to talk about. So goes the life of the lifeless. Ooh, look, potatoes!",7
"Smelly fish fin made the tea?     Think of what tonight's title rhymes with. Here's three clues.   1. It's like Television, only it's grape or strawberry. 2. It happened yesterday and I'm really happy about it. 3. If you can't get this one, then you really don't know jack.   Give up? Of course you do. Tonight's title is a Gibberish question from the ultimate quiz show party game, ""You Don't Know Jack."" And what does it rhyme with? Of course, stupid, smell fish fin made the tea! That is...  Jellyvision paid the fee!  That's right, my ProHosting problem from a few days ago is been and past, because the makers of You Don't Know Jack -- who are really happy with the forum I put together and the fan support -- are paying the ten dollar fee! I emailed them and asked for webspace, and instead they offered to pay off ProHosting. Not only that, but they're also going to register and maintain our very own www.ydkjforum.com web domain! No more long URL! No more short-but-not-working URL! A real, live, .com address, free from our pals at Jellyvision! They have to be the coolest game designers I've ever known.  That was yesterday. I would have posted here as it happened, but I was too busy with my brand spankin' new $200 digital camera. That's right, we finally bought one, and now I can take high-quality pictures for things! Overjoy! Rapture! So yesterday was a really, really, way cool day.  Oh, and also, I never mentioned that I found a place to stash MOL. anytimenow.com offers 20 megs of storage space, I love it! So now my game is up for download. Check the Deli's Pick (link's at the left) to pull it off the web.  That's my post for tonight. Life is spiffy.",7
"Austin Powers: ""Mole mole mole""     Major accomplishment today: I finished the demo for my RPG,  The Quest for the Meaning of Life!  I'm proud of the ending I put together. I not only added the ending, but I fine-tuned a lot, like EXP and enemy strength. I sat through the whole of MOL today and did some bug testing, which led to the tuning -- I found 21 things that needed a fix. I fixed it all up and prepared it for the public; I'm not, however, going to put it online yet, not onto my limited Tripod account. I need to find a storage place like I-Drive used to be to put it up, because even though it's only 1.3 megs, I'll run out of bandwidth. (Heh, I could use prohosting, but prohosting isn't free anymore.) That's all I really wanna share for today. I got to boast my Gamecube to my cousin today. It was quite fun. So long.",7
"Work, work, work...     Current Song: ""I'm Moving On,"" Rascal Flatts     How things happen the way they do, I'll never know. Andy (you know, YDKJ host and Jellyvision webmaster) and I had been exchanging emails back and forth, discussing the legal matters of JV paying our fee and all. Finally, after several emails to and from each other, he emailed me and said, ""Look, why don't you call me instead of all this slow email? It'll be easier."" So, I reluctantly (yeah, right) landed a phone call to Jellyvision HQ, Chicago. My dumb voice cracked twice... Puberty's been and gone, maybe my larynx'll catch up to me someday. Anyhow, we spoke for sixteen minutes, discussing the board and chatting about Jellyvision and the hosts of YDKJ and all. It was a grand old time.  So much to catch up on... well, business first. Adam, Jellyvision's tech guy, asked me to port all the crap from the current board to a brand spankin' spiffy new account. I downloaded it all, and... well, let's just say, headache. Here's an excerpt of my letter to Adam last night at 3.   I downloaded all the files directly from the current account into a folder on my hard drive, and downloaded both the Perl and CGI versions of the YaBB source code (partly as a source for default files, and partly since the newest version contains security patches). I uploaded everything from the old board into the new account directly (making sure to upload everything in ASCII as per the instructions) to cgi-bin/YaBB/ and tried to run it; I get a 500 Internal Server Error from ProHosting. I messed with a few of the files, reinstalling the defaults of files that could've gotten accidentally changed or corrupted, and tried again; nothing. I created a different folder -- this time named ""yabb"" instead of ""YaBB"" -- and decided to try installing the entire system all over again with the CGI version. I uploaded everything in accordance to what I remember from my experience with installing YaBB before, and tried to run it. Once again, it didn't work, so I decided to give the Perl version a try, and made one last folder -- ""forum"" -- and followed the instructions exactly. Figuring from the footer on the error messages I was getting, I assume that it's a Unix server and requires chmoding of the files, so I chmoded each file as the instructions requested, and after I had done everything just as it was asking me to do, I tested YaBB.pl and got the same vicious error message. I went to the unofficial free.prohosting.com FAQ to see if they had anything to say about my problem with the scripts, and I found instructions to chmod each file differently than what the YaBB instructions asked, because ""that's how Prohosting works.""   Shew! What a load of garbage. Oh well. I posted at the yabb support forum. All should be well, if I ever get a reply.  Neeeext... using a Best Buy giftcard, I bought a copy of Dance Dance Revolution Konamix and a dance pad recently. Like, the other day. I had to return the pad a few times due to defectiveness, but now I have a working dance pad and I've burned 200-something calories.  Cody invited me to a Bible study that'll happen tomorrow at 1. I can't wait. One thing I've always liked doing is discussing the Bible with other believers, as I told Mewd earlier after a similar discussion. It'll be super-spiffy. Maybe even spiffalicious?  One final note that I won't touch on: my dad is getting remarried. I don't know what to think. More on that later. Goodnight, Saigon!",7
"The old words are reiterated again     Current Song: ""Smoke,"" Ben Folds Five     This entry isn't going to be long. I pointed IE to Blogger ten minutes ago and it just now finished the loading process.  Today, one of my first friends at my school, David, left. It just goes to prove one of my mottos.   Life happens, things change, people move on; can't expect things to stay the same forever.   The reason is really complicated and I'd rather it go without saying just now. But, my dear friend David has left the school, and I've probably seen the last of him today.  I added a song thing under the title bar. Other people do it, so why not. I don't feel up to avoiding conformism tonight.  This has just been an all-out terrible, stressful, depressing day. I want to end it with God's gift of sleep. Oh, wait, I can't -- homework. Overjoy. Well, I'll be off to do my homework while eating pizza and waiting for The Cosby Show to hit the air.   Note in advance: I apologize for not changing the ""last updated"" thing beside the link to my blog on AIM. I signed off already and don't wanna get back on. And I also apologize for the wrong coding in my last entry; I used [b] instead of   (without the period there, for the HTML deprived). The YDKJ forum uses [b] for bold, and I just finished posting there, so I used it instead. I'll fix it now. End this day already...!",7
"Unessential     Current Song: ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,"" Elton John     I don't know why Goodbye, Yellow Brick Road is my current song... it's going through my head.  Sorry for the lack of updating. Haven't found the time. I got it up and done Friday, and the YDKJ Forum is now the lowest of my priorities. It's all finished and together again, just waiting on the .com to be prepared.  Next... one of the two biggest things on my mind at this time: the weekend. I don't know. I love my dad and want to see him happy, but he's getting married on Saturday, and I'm very uncomfortable with it. I like Chris, I really do; but there's just something about seeing my dad marry another woman, somebody that isn't my mom -- and furthermore, I'm his best man and, since there's no priest (it's only a ceremony), I'm reading his vows off. That's a major struggle right there, reading off vows from my dad to another woman... I'm not going to let him down, though. I'm going to swallow my emotions and do it in a happy manner. But there's just inner hurt that I don't quite know how to deal with.  I won't get into the second big thing now. I won't boast about tomorrow until I know what tomorrow brings. (Not tomorrow per se, but tomorrow as in, the future.)  I just feel unnecessary, unessential, that everything I'm striving for is in vain. All the work I do, the hope I reserve, and the promising I make, it all feels like the wall's crumbled down and there's nothing to inspire me to pick up the pieces. I just feel like nothing I'm doing has any reason and that everything I understand is slipping away from me.  Pray for me, I need it.",7
"One hundred two point six     Current Song: ""Hot Blooded,"" Foreigner     Hot Blooded's been going through my head a lot in the past couple days. Well, one part specifically: ""I'm hot blooded, check it and see -- I've got a fever of a hundred and three.""  Yes, guys and gals, for the past three or four days I've been sick with some kind of flu or something. Tuesday night, I came home from my aunt's house and felt my head burning. I took my temperature, and clocked in at 99 point something... great. I felt like I was gonna throw up. Luckily, it's Friday night and I'm happy to announce that my face has not hugged the toilet bowl. However, it  has  hugged the ice pack.  Wednesday I had no school, my teacher's mother-in-law died and since it's a really small school and everyone's close to each other they called it off Wednesday due to her funeral. I wasn't feeling too bad Wednesday afternoon and all, and Wednesday night wasn't too bad aside from my eyes starting to burn.  Now we shuffle along to Thursday morning. I sat up and asked Mom if I could stay home since I'd been feeling a bit under the weather. She decided to try and get the best of me and said that the only way I'd be kept home is with a temperature of 100. She didn't think that would happen. I shoved the thermometer under my tongue and waited for the woman inside to announce my temperature. Okay, so I cheated a little -- I looked at the digital screen and saw my temperature in advance, but nonetheless I pulled it out of my mouth at 100.5. I was happy -- no school! Mom didn't really know what to say, but it WAS over 100 and thus I stayed home.  It was cool that I was staying home... until I awoke again two hours later. I spent all morning and afternoon in my bed, mostly watching SNL reruns (Alec Baldwin is awfully unfunny) and stand up comedy on Comedy Central. At three, I started surfing the channels looking for something else to watch. I turned on Montel Williams. Rape victims convict a serial rapist -- the topic caught my attention (no, I'm not some freak that's turned on by rape; I just love hearing about people bringing a criminal to justice) and that occupied my screen till 4. By that time, my eyes were burning up and watering like a broken faucet, so I rested my head and tried sleeping. Mom returned from the store and I took my temperature. I felt lovely after hearing the tinny woman in the thermometer announce my body temperature -- 102.3. Mom gave me an ice pack for my burning head and I tried sleeping. Somewhere in there, the temperature climbed to 102.6. Mom called the doctor and asked for her advice. The doctor advised her to give me some Motrin. I took the medicine at 5:30 and by 6:30 I was up and out of bed. I ate (veal parmesian, yum!) and got onto the computer. My fever had managed to drop to 98.8 -- joy. Time passed. At 11:45 I got offline and took my temperature. It was back up to 101. I ended up taking two more Motrin pills at 12:45 or so and tried watching two of the final three episodes of Cheers. I fell asleep at 1:45.  Woke up. Friday. I wasn't going to school. I relaxed in bed for a while; turned on the TV and watched more standup comedy. I don't really remember what all happened today, aside from playing Metroid Fusion and eating chicken-broccoli soup. I took more Motrin at 3:30 and got out of bed at 4:30. I fed the cats, drank some Mountain Dew and got back on the computer... and here I am.  So, that's my last couple of days. Still with me? Good. I'm sorry I haven't updated recently, it's sort of obvious why I haven't. So here's the update. Now that you're done peering into my life, why not download  Opera 7  and see the browser I'm now in love with? It DEFINATELY beats Internet Explorer and looks pretty cool, too. Yeah, Opera rocks. There, I plugged them.",7
"Life Simulation's a Hoot     Current Song: ""Zelda: The Music of my Groin,"" by Shael Riley     Don't ask about the song. For your sake.  Life simulation's a hoot. John's gotten me hooked on the Animalese-speaking world of Animal Crossing. That game is more fun than a life simulator should be. Of course, it was only a matter of time before those people hooked on video games and computers would need a life sim, and it's only those people who get full satisfaction out of living a pretend life. The game is increduously fun, and even the ""real-time"" bit feels appropriate. For the first time in a game, I actually felt ""just seconds too late"" as it was 10:02 and the store closed at 10, making me just two real minutes late. It's just the weirdest thing, a game that's awake when you are.  Anyhow, I don't have very much to speak of now... everything's back to normal and all, and things are quiet. I follow up a giant post with a tiny one. Faretheeallwell.",7
"Hey! I didn't die!     Current Song: ""Yesterday,"" by the Beatles     No! I'm alive! I just haven't updated, and for a good reason:  Because I don't like Microsoft.  Yes, Microsoft ties into it. Recently, well, not recently, about two months ago, I changed browsers to Opera, and Blogger doesn't work right with Opera. I guess they changed something or something like that, but now I can update in Opera, although the window's a little small -- anyway, I couldn't use Opera and would have to use IE, and I hate IE, mostly because it doesn't work on my computer, and partly because it's slow and Opera has a lot of cool features. (You get spoiled on being able to move Back and Forward with the mouse.) So, that's why I haven't been updating.  That, and my life is boring.  If you must know, recently: I got into Magic: The Gathering, I got into Zelda: The Wind Waker, and I got into bed and slept a few times. I don't really know what else interesting has happened. Steve's gonna come up to Ohio and visit this Summer, which I'm really excited about. I'm itching to face him in Super Smash Bros. Melee. Oh, and I've relaunched my  urlLink site , and now have a redesign and more content. Last night I finished The Bed That Ate You -- why not go take a look?  Oh, and I had a birthday! Yes, I'm another year older. And for my birthday, I received two tickets to see the all-time funniest comedian ever tomorrow night -- Bill Cosby. I CAN'T WAIT. (This entry says April 19th because it's 1:30AM, but tomorrow night means the night of April 19th.) It's gonna be spiffy!  That's all for now, I'll update again soon. Now, back to my song.",7

It was a lot of fun and it was great to be seeing the man in person.  I really don't have very much to say... went and bought a Sliver deck in Magic. I love Slivers, they're spiffy and useful.

"Stuff and computer upgrades     Current Song: ""Bring Back the Sun,"" Our Lady Peace     Today's just not been a good day. The start was fine, the end is... eeech. That's all I'll say.  I got my laptop about a week ago... $50 for four gigs, 80 megs of RAM, and 233mhz processor. I like it, it's useful, mostly for keeping my journal protected and hidden. (It's also a great way to play Half-Life.)  I also got a new hard drive from my dad... eighty gigabytes as opposed to the seven I had. It was all installed on the same day I got the laptop (April 24) and it works fine. And there's nothing much else new, so I'll just end this entry now.",7
"The Dragon at rest     Current Song: ""Mercyful Fate,"" Metallica     Okay, so we didn't drop SBC after all. Heh.  Mom managed to somehow get an SBC technician to come to our house for free, to get everything taken care of and out of the way for no charge at all. I'm impressed, dunno how she did it, but she did, and now we have our DSL up again.  I guess I can trust it. As it turns out, Brad found problems with our phone line. Surprising, considering our wires are so old, they probably gave Moses his phone line. Furthermore, the modem was shot in the first place, and the guy replaced it for free. I don't blame SBC for the problems; I originally thought it was the weather giving us problems, but it was our wiring all along that must've been jolted by the stormage. So now I'm back on my high speed. I love it, and missed it.  But now... I have nothing to do online. Maybe I'll go download some E3 trailers... Metroid Zero Mission's gonna be spiffy, by the way. Cheerio.",7
"Urgh... times infinity.     Current Song: ""Yesterday,"" The Beatles     Yes, I already used this song a few entries ago. But you know what? It kind of fits.  Saturday was wonderful. I installed a DSL router and we picked up a wireless card for my laptop, so I could plug the ethernet cable on into the router and have a split connection, the PC and the Laptop both online at once. It was COOL. The wireless connection rocked, it gave me hardly any problems and was a sinch to set up. I was up till five in the morning, just talking away, surfing, using the internet from my room.  Then Sunday struck. And when Sunday struck, ""Yesterday"" came into play. ""Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away... now it looks as though they're here to stay.""  Sunday morning, I woke up, and guess what. The DSL light on my modem -- off! Yes, boys and girls, my DSL just stopped working. I spent most of Sunday fooling with wires, talking with technical support, scolding my modem, everything... it just didn't work. The DSL light would flicker, and sometimes it would stay on for two minutes, sometimes five minutes, sometimes it wouldn't even find a connection at all. Eventually, I deducted (yes, deducted -- not deduced, deducted) that something was wrong with the phone line, seeing as our phone was really staticy, but I wasn't sure.  *Click, click* Monday! I came home from school, and the DSL light was ON. Yes! It worked! For about fifteen minutes, that is. Then it flickered, and came back on within fifteen seconds. That's the story of yesterday. I'd be online for a nice chunk of time, then get kicked, and then get on, then kicked, and eventually it started kicking me into submission and I couldn't even get online. That's yesterday.  *Click, click* Fast forward to today. I come home from school... nothing. The power light was on, but the others were all off. No signal what-so-ever. And to top it off, our phone didn't work. It would be on for half a minute, with a bunch of static, then I'd get a dial tone. That was definately from the phone line, so I was right that it's giving us trouble... it's just too coincedential to not be the phone line. The phone problems and DSL problems started at the same time. Not that it matters anymore, though, because after watching the modem do absolutely nothing, then turning it off and on and watching it malfunction a bit, I called technical support. Guess what? My DSL modem is dead. Shot. No more. Down the drain. Kaploosh.  We're at a decision point. Either we sort out the many, many problems with the DSL, get a new modem, and then go through more trouble later... or, we kill the DSL bit and switch to Adelphia PowerLink Cable. I'd like to keep the DSL, because I don't wanna change my email address and I get 700mb or so of web space that I need to house files for my website. However, I am TIRED, sick and tired, of putting up with it! I want to get something that works. DSL was fine for a year, no problems whatsoever, nice speed, etc. But when the problems started hitting, they weren't minor problems, they all had a huge payload that threw me into a boat somewhere in the middle of Lake Erie and ran off with the paddle. So, I don't wanna put up with it anymore. Unfortunately, until we get things sorted, I have no broadband connection... but I have a solution.  While we get everything all together with what ISP we use, I'm going to sign up for a free trial of AOL. LUCKILY, my laptop came with a 56k modem, so I popped that in, threw in a phone cable, installed AOL, and got online using my uncle's screenname. (Sorry, it was my only choice... besides, you guys were in bed when I got on anyway!) That's where I am right now... on AOL. Tomorrow I intend on going for a free trial, so I can at least correspond with the world while we work on getting together broadband. Ahh well. That's my entry... huge as it is. That's my last couple of days. Aie...  OH! BUT BEFORE I GO! LUCASARTS RELEASED A TRAILER FOR SAM AND MAX: FREELANCE POLICE, THEIR NEW SNM GAME!!! WAA-diddily-HAAHAAA!! ...anyway. Yeah. Go watch it.

"'Could it be? Could it really, truly be?'     Current Song: [Space Quest Four MIDI soundtrack]     We may have isolated the problem. Every time it's rained since we got the router two weeks ago, the DSL's been killed. The first time, Brad the Tech Guy came out and solved our problems. Until it rained again. Then the DSL was killed. That would be my last entry, 5/20.  Well, two nights ago, my youth minister suggested I unplug our cordless phone from the wall and see what happens, if it was fixed. So yesterday, I unplugged our cordless. After about an hour and a half, the DSL was stable. So today, I plugged it back in after school. After an hour and a half or so, while it drizzled a bit, the DSL flickered back out. I unplugged it. Hour and a half later, it came back. And that's where I am now. It seems that the cordless phone is our problem... however, it's supposed to rain more this weekend. We're going to keep the phone unplugged and if the DSL goes out when it rains, then the phone isn't the problem.. but as it seems right now, the phone is the problem. At least, the phone jack could be it... I don't know. But I seem to be back online now... I keep watching the modem to see if I lose the connection. Hasn't dropped it yet, and as of this writing, it's been on for half an hour. Well, thirty five minutes.  So, we'll see.",7
"The Re-revenge of Yesterday     Current Song: ""Yesterday,"" The Beatles     I am so mad right now.  It's been four glorious days of broadband for me. After the tech came out and fixed our lines, I was online again. IT ALL ENDED ONCE MORE TODAY! Ugh! I don't know if I can take this anymore! It stormed again, and now that it stormed my DSL flickers in and out. I'm back on Dialup... AGAIN... and I hate it...  Is it so bad for me to have a working connection?  Gah... well, I have this AOL trial until June 20 or so, so it'll be available until Steve comes to visit. Around there, at least. I guess a month is more time than I think, so hopefully it'll be once again sorted out. Things looked so good, too...  We want to stay with SBC, we really do. What are we supposed to do? I'm not going to keep this up. Here's to praying we get another free tech if needs be... because right now, it looks like it needs be. Sigh...  On another note, I've modified my layout, and changed the header colors to fit. Don't know why you care, though.",7
"The World Has Turned and Left Me Here     Current Song: ""Selfless, Cold, and Composed,"" Ben Folds Five     I hooked the phone back up at three to call Jessie today. My DSL's stopped really kicking me off... it stopped responding once, but it was different. It didn't flicker out, but just kinda froze while the router tried to contact it. It's now 11:43, so it's been solid for the past eight hours and forty three minutes... except that fluke. What do I make of this? It's not the phone that's the problem. It's OBVIOUSLY the wiring, and since Brad the Tech Guy fixed our wiring -- not to mention the fact that our phones and the phone upstairs in my aunt's house is screwy -- it's most likely outside the house. On the phone with Jessie earlier, it was kinda staticy. The DSL isn't following a pattern as to how it shuts down... it just stays on or doesn't. I managed a few games of Starcraft with Mewd earlier, too. I have no doubt that it'll flicker off again. But for now, it's okay... and the phone works and all... so... yeah. I'm going to bed.",7

He's been here for a couple days, and will be here until tomorrow, when he flies back across the United States to go home to his room decorated with the colors of his site.  Anyhow, I'm going to make this entry short; ever since June 4th, my DSL has been fixed. Pete the Tech Guy came out and looked at the wires, and sure enough, they were crappy. They were so messed up, any rainwater would screw over the line... so, yeah, it's been fixed and stable, and I haven't been on dialup in ages. And that's just about everything I have to say.

But I'm no longer single -- sorry, ladies, I know you were all after me, but that's the way the ball drops. (Okay, so only one lady's been after me, and she's now my girlfriend. Sue me.) So, yeah, that's great.  Second, I got my job! Finally, after stalling a phone call for a long time, I am now a maintenance assistant at a hotel. I'll be doing some janitor work and helping the maintenance guy, but now I'll be working! Finally! Money to go toward my new iBook! And I get the hours that I wanted!

Plus, I'm working a steady noon to four, weekdays only, so I get my nights and weekends. I'm gonna have that iBook!  I went out and got a Blockbuster Freedom Pass today... mom's paying for it, but I'm gonna pay her back when I'm paid.

And if I like it, I reinstate it and get it next month. And etcetera. It's a great deal. Tonight I rented MGS2: Substance, but I'll be taking it back tomorrow and probably getting Enter the Matrix. I just wanted to see how Substance was, and what was in it... but I've already beaten MGS2 several times and don't really need to go through it again, so I'm gonna go grab something else.

Just posting some last minute worries about the job. I'm jittery, and want to find out just what's going on with my scheduling and stuff. I really want weekends off... all I need is 20 or 25 hours a week. Hopefully, 25, so I still have around $100 a week after tithe... but whatever I get is good. I'll hopefully be able to work after school when I go back, so if I don't raise the $1000 by the end of summer, I should still be cool. We'll see... I just don't want to give up too much time with my internet friends. The few people I constantly talk to are pretty much my life. Especially my girlfriend. So.. yeah. 1:08AM.

I'm definately not getting that iBook by the end of the summer. I was just laid off for two weeks from my job... they decided that they don't have the money to support me, so I can't go back to work until Jason, the usual evening maintenance guy, leaves to return to college. And besides, I'm spending my money left and right as it is... I ordered Discworld Noir last weekend, and just ordered Tony Tough and Gabriel Knight 3 tonight... all adventure games. I won't play GK3 until I've played GK2, which Jessie's going to lend to me. But Tony Tough just looks plain cool. It's a revitalzation of hope for our little genre. I mean, come on, any developer COURAGEOUS enough to make a 2D game in late 2002, and to make it really, really good for that matter, PROVES that there's hope left in the world for adventure gamers.  And Discworld Noir's pretty cool, too. But that's a couple years old and 3D. I'm not saying it's bad, by no means. But Tony Tough is just really refreshing in that it's brand new, pretty much, and 2D.  I'll shut up now.  So yeah, my job WAS going good, and it will be going good again when I go back to work. It's a cool job, I enjoy it, and I get a good pay for my first job and all. But, whatever, it's a good vacation and I'm glad to have some more time off. I'll be working the school year, too, so... yeah. It's a good thing, because I have things to save up for -- Castlevania: Lament of Innocence, and Sam and Max: Freelance Police, and Full Throttle: Hell on Wheels, and other various wastes of money I might find.

"Luguuubrious.      Current Song: ""Richter's Theme,"" Castlevania: Dracula X   Current Mood: Quiet... where is everyone?     Well, the Christmas season is upon us. Well... the Christmas season is upon YOU. It didn't really come upon me. It snuck up behind me and nailed me in the skull with a blackjack.  Where did it come from? I don't know! I mean, I KNEW it was the Christmas season, but it's December 23rd! TWO DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS! And I didn't even REALIZE it until a couple days ago! Where did December go? Where did NOVEMBER go? Oh, I know where November went. It sped past as I pushed myself through NaNoWriMo. Which, by the way, I completed. Yes. I finished NaNoWriMo. I wrote a 50,000 word novel in a single month. Well, to tell you the honest truth, I wrote 12,000 of those words on the last day. Yes... the  last day.  Twelve thousand.  ...wow. It STILL surprises me.  Anyway, my novel isn't quite up yet for anyone to see... I didn't exactly finish it as much as meet my 50k quota. Mind you, though, I did do it. It's just nowhere to be seen yet.  Mainly because my website is dysfunctional. As I said in my last post (about a month ago... I am lazy.), ShadowOnline closed its doors. I moved to ProHosting. After Christmas, I'm going to use $10 to pull the ads off of my webspace. See, I wasn't sure if it'd be worth it to buy ad-free-ness, but seeing as my account name is renosix ( urlLink http://fire.prohosting.com/renosix ), I figure that if anything, it'll be great for any pages I make, since it's not exclusively titled after The Deli's Pick. So once Christmas is done and past, I'm going to use that $10 in my wallet to buy my page away from adscurity.  And when I do, I'll be much happier.  Otherwise, you know what I did today? I finished up Fario's first demo, that's what I did. Well, the first OFFICIAL demo, of the fourth incarnation of his first game. Get all that? I haven't uploaded the ZIP file to my Yahoo! Briefcase yet, so it's not quite on the web yet. But it will be. Soon. I'm really proud of it. It consists of World One, and the World One boss fight. That's right, boys and girls, you get to  take down King Poopa with a shoe cannon.  What fun! What excitement! What a moldy loaf of bread it was to program! Hey, it's done, and that's all that matters. Now I have seven other worlds to create...  I've been playing Baldur's Gate and Riven as of late. I have to get back into BG, I haven't played it in a few days, and I have to flat out explore more of Riven. Wow, it's confusing. A lot of wanderlust... but it's spiffy wanderlust. I got the Myst Trilogy as an early Christmas gift, since it was only $20, and so as soon as I finish Riven (yeah, right, maybe summer 2004, seeing as I'm going to try my hardest to use no hints) I'll be able to play Myst III: Exile. Oh, the life of an adventure gamer...  Steve's been idle for four and a half hours. I brb'd to take a shower, returned, and he was idle. And has been. And has been. And has been. And now he's  nowhere to be seen.  I bet he fell asleep.  Also, Mewd is  completely unaware  of the elephant I bought him for Christmas. Mwahahaha! He'll never see it coming! Well, he will, since it's rather large, but he doesn't suspect a THING. Now let's hope he doesn't read my blog.  Merry Christmas, everyone. Tomorrow I'm going to my dad's house for Christmas Eve, and returning on Christmas Morn. I'll probably blog again post-Christmas... unless, that is, I get really bored on Christmas Eve and end up getting online or something. But I'll probably end up devoting my time to sitting in front of the TV, playing something that's compatible with my laptop. I wonder what Riven's system requirements are...   Edit:  AHA! Ludwiggy IMed me! SOMEBODY TO TALK TO!",7
"2004, I likes you already     Current Song: ""Brain Damage,"" Pink Floyd   Current Mood: Much happier     See? See? 2004 fi... fi... repaired my laptop problem. (Sorry, a certain key of mine coming betwen z and c is not working at the moment.)  It was a stupid solution. A VERY stupid solution. I'd done everything I usually did to correct the problem. You know what I had to do? I had to remove the battery while it was booted. That's right. While it was booted. And it worked like a charm.  Well, almost. Because now, after much knocking around of my computer to try and knock some sense into it, I guess I have a stuck key. See, it's weird. My... my... you know what, lemme copy and paste something here... x There. My x key doesn't work. In order to type the letter, I have to have it on the clipboard and paste it in when I need it. I don't know why. Furthermore, when I boot the computer, I get a tidal wave of beeps cursed at me from the speakers. After fiddling around, hitting random keys, the stuck key finally gives way or something. Also, for some odd, odd reason, I can't make a capital S or W with the right shift key. If I hold both the shift key and the letter down, then release the shift key, then the letter is typed in a bold, capital flavor. But ONLY then. Every other key works fine with the right shift. S and W work just like regular with the left shift. What gives?  Ah well. Enough about that. At least the laptop works again. I didn't lose anything, thank God.  I've decided that I'm tired of leading a life of purely digital entertainment. It's great, really, but you know, I haven't read through a book in the LONGEST time. This is all going to change. Today, I picked up the one-volume edition of The Lord of the Rings that I've had in my desk for two years and started to read it. Let's get one thing straight right off the bat -- I'm not a fan of LOTR. I don't hate it, either. I don't have any feelings for it. I've seen the first two movies, the second half-heartedly, and remember neither of them. I've always wanted to read the books, but, let's face it, I have trouble reading. For as much as I love writing, I have trouble reading books. I read words just fine. I don't have any kind of deficiency or anything. I just have trouble picturing things in books. I'm trying hard to get over that. I think it's because I try to picture what the author pictures and fail miserably, instead of issuing every character and place its own characteristics according to my imagination.  I'm trying to do more of that imagining stuff. So, I'm reading LOTR for three reasons: 1, because I'm tired of feeling like an idiot and saying that I have trouble reading the books. B, because I want to read the books and all. And III, because I'm  tired of people watching the movies then claiming to be fans because it's trendy.   Honestly, face it! LOTR is trendy now. It's popular, it's up there. Something once reserved to geeks is now a nationwide phenomenon. I don't have a problem with fantasy or LOTR or geekhood at all, mind you, but it's stupid how people are getting into it just so they can fit in. The movies are great. They're epic, they're detailed, the acting is great, the fantasy comes to life. I don't have a problem with the movies. Get that out of your head right now: I have nothing wrong with LOTR. And I don't have anything wrong with people who watch the movies and become fans through those movies. But many people I know are only into it because their friends are. They claim to be fans, but it's only a front so people will like them. This is why I want to read the books. Before I get into the movies, I want to read the books. It's an American stereotype to watch the movie instead of the book, and I don't want to fall into that stereotype. Movies are wonderful, but they shouldn't replace the book they're based on. In my humble opinion, before you go spouting off about how huge of a fan you are of the LOTR series, you have to have at LEAST a DESIRE to read the books. Josh is a big LOTR fan, but he hasn't read the books. However, he WANTS to read the books. That's an entirely different story. If you're going to be a fan, be a fan of the whole thing, and not just the movie because the movie is trendy and all of your friends like it!  ...huff, huff...  ...I'm going back to reading.",7
"One final curve     Current Song: ""The Stranger,"" Billy Joel   Current Mood: ...     Well, 2003 has thrown one last hurdle right at my face. While talking to Jessie and Mewd, I hit that little switch next to my CD-ROM drive that ejects the drive from the laptop, which always throws my computer into an instant suspend, and when I take it out of suspend, it's frozen.  Now, this has happened. Often. And when it does, I just unplug it, take out the battery, then put both power sources back in and reboot it.  Not this time.  The laptop no longer turns on. The light'sll go on and the hard drive will start to creak, but that's the end of it. Monitor never even turns on. I don't know why. Judging from the circumstances, it doesn't look like a virus or anything. For one, this has happened before, just... not for quite this long. Two, this happened because of my hitting the switch. I think it might just be because the computer is a bit overheated -- I always put it in suspend and never in shut-down, and just restart when I have to. Else, I don't know. I have the battery out and the power unplugged. I'll plug it back in later.  At the end of November, I had to reformat thanks to a software problem in which my sound poofed away. As such, I have everything from April 26th up till November 26th saved. 800mb of backup on the PC. Unfortunately, everything from November 26th up 'till now is gone. My SNES ROM collection, for instance. Oh, and  my website.  Yeah, that's gone too. Not to mention my progress in Riven and GK2, and countless other trinkets I've downloaded since. Remember that save file I never told you about where I had almost beaten Zero Wing in Round Three? Gone. This is a major letdown.  No, can't let that mindframe get a hold of me. I WILL fix that laptop. I don't know how, but it will get fixed. Somehow. Anyhow. It will. It must. It has to.  And no, I'm not going to apologize to you, 2003. I'll let 2004 be the year I fix it.",7
"The end of an era     Current Song: ""Bob,"" Weird Al   Current Mood: Pensive     Well, I'm feeling a lot better today than I was last night. I don't know what got over me. Jessie left to take a shower, and the whole time I just stared at her IM, waiting for her to come back, while listening to Dark Side of the Moon. I tried to pull myself away, but I just kept staring... and staring... and staring... and... augh! I got depressed! Help! Help! Getitoff!  Anyway, I didn't start this entry to write that. I came to write about 2003.  First off, the obligatory paragraph entitled ""Where Did the Time Go (I'm Getting Old)"" that starts these kinds of posts.   Where Did the Time Go (I'm Getting Old)   Well? Where DID it go? You know, 2003's been awfully funny. It seems like the year zipped by. I feel like I just took down the Christmas tree at the end of last Christmas. I feel like my dad just married my stepmom. I feel like I just had that sixteenth birthday party. I feel like I just saw my uncle at the Super Bowl party two months ago. And yet, at the same time, I feel like 2003 shouldn't be ending. Seriously. I feel like it's been 2003 for ages, and that it shouldn't change just yet. Why? I don't know. That's why I'm ranting about it. This year feels so funky.  Now, on to the meat of the blog entry:   What a freakin' year.   Lessee... 2003. What all happened? Well, my dad got married to my stepmom in Februrary. I turned sixteen in April. I got my domain name (mwahaha). Well, first I moved to ShadowOnline. THEN I left it and got my domain name. I had a job, for three weeks, then I got fired. Steve came to visit for a few days and put me to shame in Smash Bros. Melee. And most importantly, on June 23rd, Jessie and I started dating. It's been six months since we started now... wow. THAT shot by, fast. Hmm. Really fast.  Well, we're about to head out to dinner at the Olive Garden now. I still have to write a letter to Jessie telling her that I might not be on till later. Anyway, that's my featureette on 2003...  see you next year, hosers!   *sets up a bomb next to 2003*",7

Exactly. I've been listening to The Dark Side of the Moon for hours tonight, and it's really getting to me. The music is... confusing. I feel lost. It's entrancing, and VERY eerie. Compelling, too.

"It's December 29th! You know what THAT means.     Current Song: n/a   Current Mood: Relieved     What does it mean? That it's December 29th, of course.  Yaargh. At 9:20 or so, tragedy struck: a stinkin' search page screwed over Internet Explorer. I couldn't visit any websites -- anything I'd stuff into my Address bar would be disregarded and instead would take me to the same search page. I virus-scanned. I ad-awared twice. I reinstalled IE6. I mucked about in the registry. At 10:30-ish, I left to watch My Cousin Vinny with mom -- such a great movie. (Thanks, Steve!) 12:50 I came back, and went back to it. And about fifteen minutes ago -- around 2:40 -- I solved my dilemma. As it turns out, I wasn't scanning deep enough into the registry. I found a bunch of wmmse.com strings in there, so I deleted all of them. Stupid things.  Of course, in the process, I accidentally killed the string that told IE to put http:// in front of a URL by default. So while I solved one problem, I had another to deal with. Another reinstall of IE fixed it easy, though.  So, Merry Christmas, everyone! Christmas was wonderful for me. Remember that webspace ordeal I had in my last post? Well, for Christmas, my brother gave me a great gift -- he ordered a premium webhosting package for me. I now have 50mb of space, 10gb bandwidth, and a ton of extra features, including PHP and all that jazz. The best part about it? Mwahaha -- the fact that my new URL is  urlLink www.thedelispick.com . Yes, I have a dot com. I'm rearranging the site again -- my last redesign is way too heavy on the tables, and I want a different look. That one doesn't satisfy me. It's sort of the same, just... just... different. You'll see. Eventually.  Anyhow, I'm back to watching the Cosby Show marathon and working on my site. Stupid wmmse.com... stealing half of my night...",7
"Aaaaaaaargh     Current Song: n/a   Current Mood: Half-asleep     It's seven am... I just woke up from two nightmares. Urgh. I decided to go to bed on time last night, and ended up waking up around four or so. I was pretty thirsty, so I had some orange soda. I woke mom up, talked to her for a minute, then came back in and laid down at 4:20. I turned on the TV -- Three's Company was on until five. Good. Closed my eyes.  I couldn't fall back asleep. I laid there with my eyes closed for quite a while, but my stomach had decided to just sort of rumble for a little while. I just could NOT sleep. Eventually around 5:30 I drifted away.  I don't know when I woke up next -- somewhere in the 6 o'clock area. I had dreamt that the house and building behind me had caught on fire, and mom was out of the house. I panicked. I could FEEL the panic, even in my dream. I tried to call 911, but every time I picked the phone up, the dial tone would fade immediately. The phone lines were getting screwed up by the fire. I couldn't get online, or call the police, or anything. All I could think to do was to try and relax and play something on my PS2. I went outside, and my family was on the back porch, with firemen dressed in casual clothes working on the fire. Everything was just fine, but I was really nervous and all now, probably because in my dream my house was all rearranged and so it wasn't familiar to me. That's when I woke up.  Fell right back to sleep. That dream wasn't bad. This one was worse.  I was at Cody's house, and a lot of other people were there, mostly friends of ours. I sat down at a table with Cody and two others, and used the computer stationed there to check my mail. I opened Yahoo! Mail, and it was all weird -- this odd orange scheme. Instead of it saying that I had mail, however, it said this: ""Changes made successfully: 1."" I thought something was up, so I clicked on the one. It said ""password changed."" ...I hadn't changed my password. I went to make sure it was the same, and I got a long, huge page. There were tons of subsequent pictures with words on them from the female hacker who had changed my password. It started with an obviously fake error message saying that somebody had gotten my pasword, and then had some more jumble. Some said things like ""Don't say some stupid prayer, like 'God please help me' or any of that crap"" and whatnot. I was panting hard as I read it all, and was freaking out. I kept saying aloud, ""My password, they got my password!"" but nobody really seemed to care. Cody just shrugged at it, and everyone else was uninterested. Again, I was in a panic. I couldn't make sense of anything. After all, somebody had gotten into my mail account and changed everything around. Actually, it was all as if getting and changing my password was like giving me a virus, with the way the pictures were displayed. It surely doesn't seem like much of a nightmare to you, the reader, but man, it scared the pants off of me.  I woke up breathing heavily and sweating. I was so glad it was a dream. When my head cleared, I remembered what Yahoo! Mail actually looked like and was a bit relieved. After that, I just had to get into Blogger and write all of this down in my blog. It was my best way of having the dream written down and being able to tell anyone who cares, later on in the day. At any rate, it's 7:26 now and I want to play Castlevania a little before school. Have a good day, everyone.",7

"Bureaucracy!      Current Song: ""The Coronation,"" Falconer   Current Mood: Sick?     I came home early from school yesterday with, supposedly, a stomach virus. It's been going around. Your stomach feels as if you're very worried or really guilty about something -- hunger pains but no appetite. From then on, you enjoy a couple glorious days of discharge, with either diahhrea or vomiting. I had the symptoms. Came home at 11 yesterday afternoon, ate a sandwich, and felt just fine. So I slept. I woke up a couple hours later, called Jessie, messed around a bit afterward, etc. My teacher called sometime last night; they cancelled school today. (When your school contains 16 students, it's easy to get an epidemic going strong.) So I had a nice day off. Furthermore, apparently many are STILL sick, so school was cancelled AGAIN tomorrow. Thus, I get a weekend within a week. I'll have one day of school, then two days of weekend. Mmm-mm.  I've been playing Douglas Adam's Infocom adventure game, Bureaucracy, as of late. The game is very funny, yet pretty hard, but it's one of the only interactive fiction titles I can get into. (Surprising as Cody and I used to make these things all the time in eighth grade.) It's a fun game, nonetheless, full of confusion and annoyances and featuring a llama and a one-winged macaw.  (For those who noticed the Spider-Man 2 template, it's gone now. Why? Because it was annoying.)  And so I end this post with a quote from last night's Conan...  ""Ohhhh, what happened? Ohhhh, what happened? Ghandi happened! Goodbye.""",7
"A Monday for the Masses     Current Song: ""The Luckiest,"" Ben Folds   Current Mood: Choked up      Warning. This post contains mushy romance stuff. If you don't like it, blaeh to you.   Tonight, Jessie spent hours working on a slideshow featuring pictures of the two of us with romantic captions set against ""The Luckiest"" by Ben Folds, which we sort of consider to be our song. She spent a lot of time fixing it up and creating it and putting it together, but after it was done, she had problems sending the .exe. It wouldn't open for Mewd (whom she tested it on) or myself but it was opening just fine for her. We spent another couple hours trying to resolve the problem. She searched Photostudio 2000 for some kind of help or option or preference and I went as far as to download a couple trial versions of the program, all in an attempt to be able to open the file.  As it turns out, she had to send EVERYTHING -- the MP3 and pictures and all -- with the .exe. After she did this, I started it up, and learned for the first time what it's like to cry from happiness. It was amazing. The words were very touching, and the pictures seemed to fit the words. I won't go on and on about this, as I'm sure you, as the reader, don't care -- but it's my blog and I'm gonna write about things I want to write about, so there.  Aside from that, noooot too much else happened today. So... so... I'm done with this entry. Bye.",7
"The Expert Art of Stick Figures     Current Song: ""The Coronation,"" Falconer   Current Mood: Exhausted     Things lately have been a bit quiet. Nothing really exciting has happened before today.  Earlier, I found something incredibly interesting. At the  urlLink Janitorial Times , a fellow by the screenname of TheRisingSun had posted a fix for the SCI timer bugs in the old Sierra games, available  urlLink here . For those of you who know what I'm talking about, go check it out -- instead of slowing down your system with Turbo or Moslo, this is actually a patch for the games. You unzip the patch that applies to each game into its directory, then play it, and the timer problems are instantly solved! No more waiting forever for the elevator in Leisure Suit Larry 3! Space Quest 4, one of the buggiest games in Sierra's history thanks to the screwy time, works like a charm!  The desert in Space Quest 1 VGA is actually playable!!  As I write this post, he's only got a fix for SQ1VGA, SQ4, SQ5, SQ6, LSL3, LSL5, and PQ3, but as soon as he can get a copy of QFG4 he's going to patch that game as well. I'm sure he's also got other things planned. Either way, these patches really honestly fix the games. The timer problems become nonexistant, from serious problems (SQ4's Droid o'Death, Skate-o-Rama, Sequel Police, etc.) right down to animation problems (SQ1VGA's constant head-swivelling, super-fast cartridge retrieval droid bouncing, etc.). It's like a miracle cure, only it really IS a miracle cure! Sierra fans with timer issues, check the patches out!  Secondly, Mewd and I buckled down and got to work on Sandwich Quest today. I decided that to get more work into my projects, I'm going to base my focus on one project and stick to that instead of bouncing back and forth between games. I decided that the one solo project I have that I want most to do is The Quest for the Meaning of Life. As such, MOL is my main goal right now. Well, kind of. I want to focus my solo effort on MOL, but I want an equal emphasis on Sandwich Quest. Basically, instead of having several projects, I have two that are what I want done most, and those're what I'm going to stick to.  Anyway, yeah, Mewd and I did a lot of work on Sandwich Quest today. I had accidentally deleted the original file back a few months ago when we were working on it, and so I started rebuilding it today. We didn't have much anyway, and all the stuff that was in the file was still on my hard drive, so I managed to keep all the art and stuff. I have the entire first room rebuilt; aside from that, I have the kitchen scene done and ready to be made into a room, and Mewd already has a lot of the descriptions written. Basically, I've pushed myself all night, and it's paid off. I'm proud of what all we have, even if it isn't a lot just yet.  However, it's 5:53 in the morning, and I'm going to bed! I emailed Jessie a half hour ago as I usually do and said that I was going to bed, and then I decided to update my blog, and here it is, six in the morning, and why am I still up?

"Sunday. Yadnus.     Current Song: ""Substitutional World,"" Falconer   Current Mood: Happy     I dreamt last night. And it was a weird dream.  I think I was in some kind of game. But it was all very realistic. I think I was kind of like Dante, from Devil May Cry. I was near the end of the game, as it was really short. I told mom that I was just going to leave and go back to doing something else, but as I was walking down this long hallway to leave, I had a feeling that my arch-nemesis would show up -- and he did.  He fell from the ceiling in front of me. I don't remember much about his appearance except that he had these glowing white eyes, and strong, last-boss-like red and black armor.  We then fought. It was a REALLY taxing battle. He had very strong attacks, but I could block all of them with ease. But I could never hit him.  He would spawn these... zombie things. Only they were zombies also wearing red and black armor. They were tall and very thin, and I really couldn't do much damage. I kept on pushing them out of the way, hitting them against walls, elbowing them and the like. I guess eventually I'd kill them, but I was juggling between then and the boss.  I kept trying to figure out how to kill the guy, but I couldn't. I think I had a sword and a gun. Well, I know I had a gun. I could never harm him. He'd do this huge dash, then leap a couple times into the air and wail on me with a huge combo, but I would block it. When he would run back to the center of the hall, I'd attempt to run and hit him with a clothesline with my sword.  I thought this was effective, but I don't think it was doing much. Finally, after a long battle, I managed to get him down onto the ground. I straddled him, curled my fingers in his hair, and pounded his skull mercilessly against the floor while calling for backup.  A few of my friends came and used some kind of ritual to draw the evil spirit out of him, and he returned to normal. Then I remember drawing my gun and saying, ""No, I'm not going to let you live,"" and trying to shoot him, but the gun wasn't firing because the game was over.  And then, I woke up.  I also had a short dream about Jessie before that, but it was so  wild and passionate  that I don't DARE talk about it here. (If seeing her sitting on the couch and reading is wild and passionate, that is.)  Anyway, it's now 4:57, and you can bet your pants that they're going to be calling soon for us to go to dinner. So until they do, I'm going to continue listening to Falconer. I've spent the past ten or fifteen minutes getting my blog to publish onto my website, instead of on blogspot.com. However, Blogger can be an unfunctional piece of crap, and so it isn't working. I'll just stay on Blogspot. It's not that bad. And it's a heck of a lot easier than fighting this thing.",7
"You shall be slain; all of you!      Current Song: ""Just a Phase,"" Incubus   Current Mood: Fired up     I'm going to be performing tomorrow morning in church: a dramatic recital of Psalm 62.   Truly, my soul waiteth upon God. From him cometh my salvation. He only is my rock AND my salvation. He is my defence; I shall NOT be greatly moved.  How long will you imagine mischief against a man? You shall be slain; all of you! As a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a tottering fence! They only consult to cast him DOWN from his excellency! They delight in lies! They bless with their mouth, but they CURSE inwardly!  My soul, wait thou ONLY upon God, for my expection is from him. He only is my rock and my salvation. He is my defence. I shall NOT be moved. In God is my salvation and my glory; the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.  Trust in Him at all times; ye people, pour out your hearts before him! God is a refuge for us. Surely, men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie; to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity. Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery! If riches increase, set NOT your heart upon them! God has spoken once, twice have I heard this -- that power belongeth unto God!  Also unto thee, o Lord... belongeth mercy; for thou renderest to every man according to his work.   I especially like the second paragraph. I get loud, forceful, and convicting with my words.

"Episode 263: ""Soliciting Prayers""     Current Song: ""That's Life,"" Frank Sinatra   Current Mood: I think I'm still shaking     Just earlier I had a discussion with Kat about God. Kat, if for some reason you're reading this entry, I apologize for keeping you for so long after you first stated that you were going to leave, but I really thought it was important that I speak to you about God. There is so much I have left to say, and so many things I wish I would have said differently -- it's a struggle to pick and choose what you want to say in the flash of an instant -- but I hope what I said had some effect on you. If ever you need to speak to me about God, if you ever feel compelled to go one step over what you've learned in all your therapies and whatnot, to lean over the calice you've built up toward God, IM me. Please, IM me. I'm more than willing to help you and encourage you. I guess all I can say is one thing Mewd mentioned: there's a big difference between religion and God, and though your religion wronged you, God is completely different -- and from what you told me, entirely contrary to what you were taught. God loves you; I love you. Come to either of us and we'll help you. I really don't want to sound pretentious, but I would just like to stress how important it is to me -- somebody that barely knows you -- that you wind up with peace in your heart.  I won't go into details -- here I am, writing in a public blog about somebody else's personal life. I'm not saying any of this to embarrass her; rather, to rally a call for action. My Christian friends, please, PLEASE keep Kat in your prayers. You may or may not know her -- probably not. Still, God'll hear you. Please pray for her. Pray that she recovers from her ailments, though most aren't things that can just fade away. Pray that she learns the truth about the Lord, and His plan of salvation for us. Most of all, pray that she accepts Him in time, that she finds that He really is the closest confidant one can have. Again, not trying to embarrass her or pry into her business -- far from it. I'd just love to prove to her that God and His followers DO care about her, and the 'cruelty' she saw in Him was an object of the devil.  That's really all I can say about anything right now. Aside from my girlfriend's birthday and my horrendous pile of a day at school yesterday, nothing terribly exciting has happened lately. Go read ""The Hiding Place"" by Corrie ten Boom. Great nonfiction novelization about a Christian family in Holland that fell under Nazi oppression in WW2. The author, Corrie, became a ""militant leader in the anti-Nazi Dutch underground."" She risked everything to save the persecuted Jews from Hitler's rage. Really interesting book. Very inspiring.",7
"Weapons of Crash Induction      Current Song: ""Loverman,"" Metallica (Been a while since they showed up here...)   Current Mood: Excited     ROOTERS -- At approximately 9:30PM EST on February 11, 2004, the assault began on the dictator, Error the Fifty-Second.  President Carnahan gave a propagandous rally speech before the event.  ""The preparations have begun in our attack on Error,"" he began, invoking resounding applause.  ""Our troops will raid the swamp. They will find Error. They will annihilate on sight. This is not a test.""  The operation's treasurer, known anonymously as ""Reno,"" finished paying off his debt to the operation's commander, also known anonymously as ""New Rising Sun.""  After the transaction was complete, the commander began his ambush on the unprepared Error the Fifty-Second.  At the time of writing, Error is in exile. His land now occupied by the Forces of Good, he can only manifest where he is unexpected.  Sources say that Error the Fifty-Second had many sub-errors, lurking in such places as the slippery slope and near the wraiths.  Commander Sun is confident that the sub-errors will be brought to great justice.  Minutes after the launch, President Carnahan claimed that ""A full solution to the evil, vile, wretched beast that is Error 52 is at hand.""  ---  Amazing, no? An actual news story. Huh. Very interesting.",7
"So new, it still smells like Lysol!      Current Song: ""Wield my Sword,"" Nightwish   Current Mood: Content     I've changed things around considerably. I was getting online to update my blog and noticed a link at Blogger.com about... something about Networking, and checked it out. A click or two later and I noticed something about finding new templates for my blog. Since Blogger.com's supply is AWFULLY limited, and I've been wanting a new template for some time, I took a look at the first link on the list of sources --  urlLink BlogSkins.com . I looked through the templates available there, and eventually, under the Digital category (I was drawn here due to my geekhood), I found this one, liked it a bunch, and saved it to my drive. After a bunch of editing away at the sidebar and stuff, I present to you -- my new blog. Very cool, huh? I love it! It spiffs! Immensely!  Immensely!   (And a bajillion thanks to Steve for hosting that above image while my site refuses to let me into cPanel.)   On to more pressing matters, though! Last night I finished  The Beast Within: A Gabriel Knight Mystery.  Yes, Gabriel Knight 2, the only game from Sierra's FMV era that's actually good. The climax was a thriller. That opera... hoo, that opera. It had me shaking, not from fright, but from sheer excitement. But I finished that game, finally -- the museum in Chapter 4 held me up  forever.  Man, that was annoying. At any rate, I'm done with the game and am now moving on to Gabriel Knight 3: Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned. It's about vampires, and ancient castles, and other stuff --  in 3D.  The interface is a bit cumbersome so far, but I'll get used to it. Also, Tim Curry is NOT Gabriel. Dean Erickson is. I can't stand Curry's rendition of the novelist. Which I make a point of in the sidebar.  Anyway! I'm going to post this now, because I have to, because, I do. Gotta study for Social Studies. For an era as cool as the middle ages, the work is awfully confusticating...",7
"Funeral for a Friend     Current Song: (my Launchcast station)   Current Mood: Very unhappy     The deed is done and all is lost; my laptop is no more.  Day after day, I've struggled with that beast. Every other day -- quite literally -- it would develop bad sectors. Its performance fluctuated. The sound card was somehow becoming physically dislodged from the machine, as in the past couple of days it's been suddenly cutting out sound-wise. I've had to tap or hit the chassis of the laptop where the sound card was in order to get the sound back. The monitor was already going bad, and would sometimes display funky lines on the screen. I would have to hit it a few times to knock it back into place. The thing was really banged up.  Tonight, I was hitting it to try and get my sound back, and it just blinked off. So I turned it back on. It would get past my Windows screen, then eventually just lock up. I rebooted, and Scandisk prompted; so I ran a scan. It tried to scan the directory structure but hung at 31%, claiming that a bad sector stopped it from being able to go further. It would try its little heart out to scan it but nothing was doing. I turned the computer off then back on. I was prompted with the menu that lets you boot in normal mode, Safe Mode, etc. I chose Command Prompt as I usually do to scandisk again. Typed scandisk at the DOS prompt.   Bad command or file name.   ...Okay, change directory to c:\windows. scandisk.   Bad command or file name.   Um. Dir scan*.*? There was no Scandisk.exe. Anywhere.  Scandisk.exe had been wiped out.   Alright, so, maybe I can catch a fluke and load Windows. Restarted the computer. Not even my Windows 98 screen came up. It hung right after I entered my hard drive password. Crap and a half.  I eventually popped in my Windows 98 disc to see if I couldn't use it as a boot disk, or just reinstall Windows. It did an automatic scandisk to check for drive integrity. Aaaand it hung again, just like last time, at 31%. I shut down and rebooted, and then copied scandisk.exe from the CD back to my hard drive. At least that was resolved.  However, since my laptop used interchangeable CD-ROM and Floppy drives, I had to shut down in order to switch drives. This posed a huge problem -- I could only get to my command prompt using the Windows 98 disc, and I needed my floppy drive to back up things. I looked around and eventually found my old Universal Boot Disk -- if I could use that to boot my computer, I could use another disk to back stuff up.  The idea worked. I managed to get into C: and grab some documents and images. I'm going to go back sometime in the near future when things have settled down and see if I can somehow get back into Windows. There's a lot more I want to back up. Ohhh, is there a lot more. However, I'm not nearly in the mood to fiddle with it all now. I'm finally starting to ease up a bit. I've been very upset ever since it happened. I really wish I could just avoid school tomorrow and stay in bed, or maybe do something to cheer myself up. Whatever. The whole thing's a mess. I've written too much already so I won't go into my options for room-based personal computer replacement, or ""What I'm Going to Do to Get Back Online From My Room."" I still have the PC out here, but mom uses it too. I need privacy.  Top it all off with the fact that I've had the menacing smell of grape soda stuck in my nose ever since Tim drank a can of it during our Chess match earlier, right now I'm not feeling my best. I have homework but I want to play Callahan's Crosstime Saloon. Maybe I'll just shrug my homework off for a while. I need something to cheer me up.",7
"Ease of Use? On a PC? What!?     Current Song: ""I Get No Kick From Cocaine,"" Blazing Saddles   Current Mood: Surprised     I set about the gruelling task today of setting up, breaking in, and paper training our new computer. Amazingly enough...  Brace yourself.  While keeping in mind that this is Windows XP.  Still braced?   Things worked very, very, very well.   I mean it. Aside from a bad product key which disallowed me from the Office 2003 free trial (which I fixed on the phone with a Swede in tech support) everything's gone smooth. Even my printer setup!  And I've never successfully set up a printer on my first try!  It was spiffy! I managed to even print out a working page! Without hassle! AYAYAYAYAYAY!!  Yeah. I'm happy. The whole thing is wonderful. The monitor's a tad smaller than the old one but that's fine -- it's still a great picture and all. And I can bear XP. Overall, it's spifftastical. Three thumbs up.",7
"Chapter 2: Everything Happens for a Reason     Current Song: ""Superman's Dead,"" Our Lady Peace   Current Mood: Happy     Welp, we got a new computer today. One that DOESN'T suck.  2.8GHz. 256MB SDRAM. 80GB hard drive. DVD-ROM. CD-RW writer. USB ports out the yinyang (it clocks in at six, four in the back and two in the front).  It's on like Donkey Kong.   I'm really happy about the new PC. It's very spiffy; very smooth and sleek. It runs things in a very... very... very new-y manner. It's all Windows XP so the bells and whistles are present. I don't intend on removing it; I have the other PC in my room now (which is where I'm at) and it uses Windows 98SE, so I'm happy. Yes, speaking of, I'm glad about having the PC in here now -- 400mhz, 80gb hd, 128mb RAM, it's not as good, but it's still spiffy. It's been the best I've had for years and years. And while now a new computer has overthrown it, it still lives on in my room, thriving and giving me privacy and other neat stuff, like doughnuts.  But yeah, new computer, replacement for the laptop, and I'm happy. Finally, my computer desk has a use!",7
"Troubled Waters     Current Song: ""Like the Rain,"" Clint Black   Current Mood: A bit upset     Many things to touch on in this update of El Bloggo.  First and foremost,  The Passion of the Christ  is one of the most powerful, influential, and humbling movies ever produced. The film speaks so much strength and really is a very refreshing event. People direly need to see just what Christ went through when He was crucified, and it took Mel Gibson to show them this side of His life.  Secondly, LucasArts has officially lost about 5,000 fans with their  urlLink cancellation of Sam and Max: Freelance Police.  A petition has risen to save the game from the knife of the LEC Glukkons. It's already been cancelled, but we're revolting in protest of the cancellation. Please, if you have any adventure game spirit in you or if you're a big fan of Sam and Max or if you loved Hit the Road or if all of the above apply to you,  urlLink write them a letter expressing your disgust  or  urlLink sign the petition to bring it back.  This is an outrage. They'll know their mistake.  Thirdmost, Warcraft III is the most fun I've had in a real-time strategy game since, well, since forever. As much as I liked starcraft, WC3 changes everything around and turns the RTS genre upside down. I LOVE the single player campaigns; I'm actually rather good at them. I REALLY suck at multiplayer, though, so I stray from battle.net play. But for an introvert, single player is enough for me. And when I finish the four campaigns of Reign of Chaos, I have the expansion, The Frozen Throne, to look forward to. What a wonderful world.  Anything else? No, don't think so. Go see The Passion of the Christ. You must see this film. You need to see this film.",7
"Lovesick     Current Song: ""A Kiss to Build a Dream On,"" Louis Armstrong   Current Mood: Melancholy     The current song is a really, really good one. Mewd sent it to me; it's the theme from the PC game, Fallout 2. I was looking for some 50's-style music for something I'm working on, and while it isn't bouncy like I wanted, it's a very good, very slow song.  I'm really feeling out of whack and disoriented right now. My grandmother, great-aunt, aunt, and uncle are going to Florida for ten days with travel time, and again, they're calling on me to mind their house while they're gone. I'll be watching over my aunt, uncle, and grandmother's house while two of my cousins are taking up my great aunt's house next door. With my cousin David living at my aunt's house, it'll essentially be four cousins watching two houses.  This usually isn't a problem, but apparently, David's recently started to use the computer after everyone goes to bed. Hopefully there's no contention for computer use. Also, since my aunt wants to use AOL in Florida, and doesn't want the account tied up, I'll be installing SBC Yahoo! Dial-Up over at her house, and using that to get online. I may just take my computer over and hook up all the peripherals to it, so I can have a familiar experience over there. With this there, my cousin probably won't be too inclined to use it as it's mine. However, I'm not sure. I'll probably just use hers, and if I direly need my own PC, I'll take it along. I'm not sure.  At any rate, the whole thing has me discombobulated. I've been sick for the past couple of days. Nothing serious -- diahhrea -- but all of last night, I had the distinct queasy feeling that I'd be vomiting. I spent two and a half hours going in and out of the bathroom for long periods of time. While I finally lied down at 2:40 or so, I didn't actually fall asleep until 4 -- I just half-dreamed (you know, that thing where you're conscious, but vivid thoughts are swimming in your head). I woke up again at 7 when mom went to work, and then actually got up at 11. I felt much better, at least. Still, that's the second day this week I've taken a sick day, the first being Tuesday (I had the bug mildly but thought I had it bad). I'm not ready to go back, and I still don't feel all together. I feel like things are happening really fast. And at the same time, I'm really emotional -- maybe it's due to lack of sleep, or a combination of that with the traces of the bug still in me, but since Jessie left about half an hour ago, I've really, really missed her. Maybe it's because the song is really romantic and melancholy or something -- I dunno. All I know is, I really wish I could talk to her again soon. I'll probably call her before bed, as I always do, but... I dunno. I miss her.  Soon, we're going over to my aunt's house again. It's 9:45 at the moment I write this. They're leaving at 5:00am. Thusly, we won't be there to see them off, unless mom and I wake up early. Anyway, we're gonna go over there to say goodbye and for last-minute instruction and all that. I guess I'm just really nervous. I feel very alone, and I don't know why.  Have a great weekend. I'll write again when I'm all settled in. Sorry for the delay between posts.",7

"Current Song: ""Whiskey Lullaby,"" Brad Paisley   Current Mood: Melancholy?    I'm sorry that I've forgotten lately to update the ol' weblog. When I was at my aunt's house, the dialup, combined with the forced 800x600 resolution and ultra-dim monitor, didn't exactly leave me wanting to update.  The housesitting went about as well as possible. Catch an update: the ten days went slightly roughly, with me spending a lot of time cleaning and my cousin spending a lot of time not cleaning. When I'd finally be done cleaning and doing homework, he'd be online. For the most part, everything was alright, I suppose. Well worth the $100 pay, even though I wasn't really doing it for the money. A few days after finally leaving their place, I spent a weekend over at my brother's. Talk about refreshing. I had minimal cleaning up to do and plenty of freedom and aloneness. They didn't pay me, but that's no problem at all -- I didn't expect any money for letting the dog out, eating Chips Ahoy and playing Baldur's Gate. It was more of a vacation than anything.  Now, back to the present. I've had both Whiskey Lullaby and A Kiss to Build a Dream On in my head all day, and I was listening to both as soon as I got home, but eventually dropped off Kiss and am now just listening to Whiskey Lullaby. It's a really sad song, about two people who drank themselves to death over each other.   ""She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger, And finally drank away his memory. Life is short, but this time it was bigger Than the strength she had to get up off her knees. They found her with her face down in the pillow, Clinging to his picture for dear life... We laid her next to him beneath the willow, While the angels sang a whiskey lullaby.""   Mewd once said that he thinks it's silly when people post lyrics, because you don't get the full effect unless you hear the song. This applies. The song, as Jessie described it, is painfully eerie. Definitely the saddest song I've heard in a while. And you know what? I love it. I really dig slow, sad songs like this.  At any rate, today wasn't too bad. The past few weeks, however, have been hellish. My schoolwork is really falling behind, and getting very late. I finally finished another part of Chemistry today -- I surprisingly aced the self-test with a 100 -- but Geometry and English are still nipping at my heels. Once I finish Geometry and English, though, I'm  finally  in the clear. It'll feel good... really good. It's like when you're guilty of something, and the pain is eating away at you, clenching your heart and wringing it out, until finally you confess to someone, anyone, and the pain dissipates. Ashley's felt the same heat I have. We both feel like we're pretty much under the gun -- our infinitely untactful teacher loves to make us feel terrible with remarks that we would readily accept as advice with any other tone of voice. I dunno -- once I get this stuff done and in, I'll feel so much better. Much better.  On the brighter side, I've added two additions to the Compaq -- another 256 megs of RAM and a 64 meg GeForce MX 4000 video card. It's all souped up now, and plays Halo like a dream. Now I just need to get a job so I can buy Armed and Dangerous (the only exception I'm making to my 'boycott LucasArts' mindset -- it's my duty as a Sam and Max 2 revolutionary to support such a wonderfully made original effort at a game). I'm going to take my brother's advice and look into a job at the local cemetary. Nobody would bother me there, and personally, I'd rather be haunted than deal with other human beings.  I think that's enough for this entry, though. I'm going to do my homework then read or something for a while, waiting for Jessie. Heads up, Deli fans -- I have a new design in the works and I'm currently learning the humongously-awesome Inform programming code for making text adventures, or interactive fiction, if you will. IF is my oldest programming passion. One last thing: I've updated the sidebar to reflect current-ity. Catch you later.  > quit  Are you sure you want to quit? (Yes or no.) > yes",7
"Current Song: ""I Believe,"" Diamond Rio   Current Mood: Productive (!)    Heyo, folks. Ready to blog? I sure am.  Confused by the title? I'm sure you are. Let me run it down for you, nice and easy: I'm wiping away my computer and starting fresh. I've reformatted computers several times; I'm a reformatting  demon.  Let's see, I formatted my computer twice, then eventually got a new hard drive, and I formatted my laptop once. So that's about four fresh starts. Anyhow, this is all ancient history; what you're concerned with is the here and now (or, actually, in your case, the there and then, as you're probably not reading this as I type it, unless you're a hacker watching my every keystroke, and if you are, please bring me a doughnut, I want doughnuts).  Here's the deal. My computer now has taken a liking to the dark side of freezing. It's flirted with such evilness several times, even managing a convoluted fit of blue screens, once, where I could only use it one in four times after booting. It just wouldn't work -- it'd load to the desktop, then, all of a sudden, without warning, without so much as a peep or a click -- WHAMMO! Blue screen! Recently, though, it's decided to itself, ""Say, I think I'll just freeze upon the occurance of some random little process deep in the bowels of my monstrous bulk."" (And it's bulky, all right. I once found a small child trapped inside.) ""Let's see, how can I really ham this up? How can I truly peeve off the Typer Of The Keys? Think think think... aaahhhh... aha! Genius! I'll  stop responding to everything he does,  yet at the same time I'll let him  move his mouse all over the screen!  And while I'm at it, while I'm at it... ohhh, baby, while I'm at it, I'll make a  slow, quiet ticking,  to make him THINK I'm doing something, but then ultimately letting him down when he realizes that I've committed neo-seppuku once more! Whoa! When can I start this... when when when... how about... how about next time he boots! Oh, Gatey,"" (my computer calls itself Gatey because it's a retard) ""you are amazing. Give yourself a pat on the metallic hull, you nutsy beast.""  This is the gist of my problem: random freezing. Among other things, of course. My massive 80-gig hard drive will likely take quite a while to format, so I'm going to go take care of that now. It is 4:29. I'll write again in a bit -- sayonara!  -~-  Hey, blog reader! The time is now 7:53, and the formatting is well on its way. It's formatting at about 1%/15 seconds, so that's 4% in a minute. 40 in ten minutes, thus 80 in twenty, thus 100 in twenty-five -- it'll be done around 8:15. There's your Math Example of the Day?, kids.  I have five CDs worth of stuff; three containing data that I'm wanting to keep, and two containing old laptop backups that I don't want to risk losing. I thoroughly, thoroughly scanned through my computer, combing C:, C:\Program Files, and my Programs menu. I found things buried in deep, but the only things I couldn't recover were my Neverhood saved games -- I don't know WHERE The Neverhood programmed them to save to, but they sure as heck don't go in the DreamWorks Interactive/Neverhood folder. Crazy people.  I'm pretty happy that I'm finally doing this. You know, even in its last hours, that computer gave me problems. It developed a nasty habit in which it would freeze for about thirty seconds every time I deleted files. I did a lot of deleting, too. In fact, I even did something childishly destructive, but it felt really good...  You know how, when you go into the Windows folder, it tells you not to EVER MESS WITH THE FILES INSIDE BECAUSE IF YOU TOUCH THEM,  YOU WILL BE TOTEMIZED ? Eheheheh... before quitting to DOS to format C:, I went into the Windows folder, and I  deleted random files!  Oh, it felt wonderful! I drug my cursor into a big box around some files, then hit Shift+Delete and wiped them out. Several times! My Windows folder looked like a post-war street with all the unpatched holes in it. Take THAT, Microsoft! And that! And that! ...And this, also!  So... so yeah. I'm gonna go on ahead and post this now -- thanks for sticking around to read my onslaught of C: formatting goodness.

"Current Song: ""Metroid Prime Theme,"" who do you think?   Current Mood: Ecstatic    Holy crap! Has anybody seen the latest from Nintendo at E3? Another realistic Zelda game!

Also of note might be  urlLink GameSpot  or something. Just go feed on screenshots and videos of the latest technology. E3 never ceases to amaze.  Before I go, some food for thought: until 2002, Nintendo hadn't released a Metroid game for almost ten years. Two years later, they've announced their fifth since Prime was released. Metroid, Metroid 2, Super Metroid, Metroid Prime, Metroid Fusion, Metroid Zero Mission, Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, and Metroid Prime: Hunters. Does Nintendo know a cash cow or WHAT?",7

"Current Song: ""Back Back Train,"" Aerosmith   Current Mood: Ever realize how silly this ""Current Mood"" bit is?    I'm sitting here at Microsoft Works, pulling my hair out over an English assignment. It's driving me up the wall. I have to write an editorial on some current event, debatable situation, or news item. After several starts, I just can't seem to pull off the assignment.  I started by trying to write about how America hates President Bush, and the world hates America, and everybody thinks we're policing the world. I wanted to take a stance against all this for once, and argue for America instead of against it. I gave up after a few failed paragraphs, though, and now have decided to write about how terribly corrupted America's youth is today. I want to write a moving article about the vices that most teenagers so willingly accept. I'd just love to put together a rousing rally against trendy people with their trendy rap music and their annoyingly ""fashionable"" clothes  (what is so appealing about the color baby-blue, throwback jerseys, or $200 shoes!?) . Maddox said it best: we don't need 'metrosexual' pretty boys like Ben Affleck. We need real men, like Gregory Peck. I'm tired of seeing all these preppy pretty-boys. We need more lumberjacks and pirates. Men who wear flannel instead of cargo pants. This is what I need to stress in my argument.  But how do I start it?  I've given it more openings than the World's Largest Sponge, but none of them seem to fit. I know WHAT I want to fight; I just don't know HOW. So here I sit, blogging on this  urlLink annoying new Blogger interface  (yes, it's terrible), while listening to Aerosmith and trying to squeeze an idea out of my pea-sized brain.  Speaking of Aerosmith, I just picked up their newest CD today: Honkin' On Bobo. I read about it returning to the band's roots. The songs are all bluesy-rock, and they're very well done. Aerosmith's last CD, Just Push Play, was decent. I liked it, but the novelty wore off fast. This new disc is an entirely different story. The songs are thick and dirty, and have much more heart than the crap running through our airwaves today. (Just where did AC/DC stop and ""NoFX"" and ""Audioslave"" begin? ""Tantrix?"" What? My God, I wouldn't be able to tell you the difference between these faceless, hyped-up numbers if a Soviet threatened to shoot me in the face with a bazooka.)  Anyway, I should get back to my work now... I just have no ideas. I even had trouble writing this blog entry. Everything I say keeps feeling heartless, limp, and flat. Yaarg, I can feel myself digging deeper into the rut with every phrase I guillotine with my backspace key. Look there, I just went back and added a sentence that I missed before.

Lessee, I also watched a bit of the Matrix: Reloaded. Man, that Smith fight scene was spiffy. ""Me, me, me."" ""Me, too!""  Is it just me or do kids suck? A group of three five-year-olds decided to tease the dog today. They accomplished this by pounding on the bedroom window and playing ""ring the doorbell then run like little five-year-olds about to receive a bloodthirsty hammer claw in the back of the neck."" That game was a blast. Here's how you play by example.  I hear the doorbell ring. ""Who could that be?"" I think to myself. I look up, and lookie there -- nobody at the door. So I get up and walk to the door, look out the window, and there's nobody there. ""What gives?"" I ask. Looking at the sidewalk I see three little black kids, two girls and a boy (I think) running from my steps.  ""So this is what we're gonna do tonight,"" I say to myself, and unlock the door. Next time I'll be ready. I sit back down and go back to blasting the Many into oblivion in System Shock 2. Ten minutes later, the dog starts barking.  I get into position.  Looking outside, I find two of the little runts walking up to the front of the house. They stand right in front of the steps and look straight up at the door. The dog is barking, so they know they're seen. Suddenly, one hoots a warcry!  ""Boo!""  HWAH! I grab the handle and fling the door wide open. One bugger dashes. The other stands. Staring. Grinning.  I glare. I close the door. I lock the door. I say, ""Good riddance.""  So after that, they left the place alone for a while. I was still pretty worked up over it, but I probably shouldn't have been -- they were only five year olds. But they were unsupervised! Three five-year-olds, roaming the street, without a single parent watching them. Where were the parents? Why, next door, listening to some awful rap song at volume level 201.  But that's entirely off the topic. Let's go back to the battle. Later on in the night, we get struck again. I hear little feet on the front porch. I get up, and make a quick Solid Snake strut to the living room. I see one advancing up the porch, turning around to look at its cronies as they cheer on its valiant efforts in budding vandalism.  It reaches for the doorbell. PHWAMP! The door flies open.  It stares at me.  The following dialogue is not even worthy of a Battle.net player.  ""Can I help you?""  ""Yeah.""  ""What do you need?""  ""Yeah.""  ""Why are you on my porch?""  ""...""  ""What do you want?""  ""I want co' inside.""  ""I'm sorry, I can't help you.""  ""Yeah.""  ""Please stay off my porch. Don't ring this doorbell.""  ""Yeah.""  The little product of unsafe sex starts to run off the porch. No sooner was my door halfway closed -- halfway closed -- when they decide that the dog in the window wanted to be teased.  She's barking, the kids are giggling, and I scream,  ""DO NOT AGGRAVATE MY DOG.""  I'm fuming. I look out the front door window to see three little cornholes rushing away from the window.  The battle was over, but I was pumped. I tossed on some loud music really fast then proceeded to get offline and brood for a little while. I wanted to read but ended up just listening to Sonne and punching a pillow. I got my frustrations out, then decided to watch some of the Matrix before getting back online a short while ago.  What a fun night!  Before I hit the ""Publish Post"" button down there on my little Blogger GUI, I leave you with this thought:  urlLink it doesn't get any worse than this.  Notice the Christopher Snow books on the chair, and take note that they were on the table when the cat got up there. G'night.",7
"Current Song: Some stuff from Leisure Suit Larry 7   Current Mood: It's 5am. What do  you  think?    So there I was, on my second day of summer vacation, when I realized that I had failed to blog for weeks.  Not anymore. Nooonono, now I'm updating again.  Lessee... what's new... oh, yeah, nothing much at all. I'm on summer vacation, which means either three months of goofing off, three months of working at a job I have yet to discover, or a nice balanced li'l mix of the two. Both have obvious merits. Either way though, I'm happy to be away from school for three months. I'm struggling lately, with work and all. Next year'll be no better, but at least I'll get a good, lengthy chunk of time in which to downgrade myself to an undereducated mass of video games and large dinners.  What else is new... what else... something... hmm, I replayed Leisure Suit Larry 7 yesterday and today. Why do you care? Dunno.  Oh, and I  finally got UHF on DVD.  I'm going to watch it tomorrow. Ahh, Weird Al filmography goodness right there, folks. ""This week, on U62, he's back -- and this time, he's mad... GHANDI 2!""  Sidebar has been updated according to my current boringness. And... and I guess that's all I have to say.  Look, I'm not forcing you to read this dribble, you're doing it yourself.",7
"Current Song: ""Four Little Metroids,""  AmIEvil     If you hesitate before hitting the snooze button on your alarm, are you being lazy?   Good question.  It's now 7:30am. No, I didn't just wake up -- I'm just now going to  sleep.  You know, this post used to say ""7:11am,"" until I  deleted the whole flipping thing on accident!  Arrgh! Twenty minutes, dust! Hrrm.  We got a lot of work done tonight on Sandwich Quest. I finished up the interior of Turnip's car, and Mewd churned out a few more descriptions. This game is really starting to take a great shape. The art is progressing nicely, the writing is, of course, hilarious, and the music is looking quite promising. In fact, Rav informed me tonight that he's already quite a ways through two songs -- Salami Mafia and the tentatively-titled Title Theme. The more we do, the more experienced and hyped up we get -- I'm honestly hoping for a fall release. At least, end of summer.  I had a lot written here, and to be honest, I really don't have the heart to rewrite it. I mean, I had a good four paragraphs -- four long paragraphs. Then I hit control-z to fix a mistake, and it deleted half of my post! Very frustrating. I'll rewrite it tomorrow night, when my feelings of enthusiasm are fresh again. Sorry about this. I'm gonna go get some sleep -- not that I'll be able to; my head is throbbing from my desperate attempts to tear out my hair.  Go read my profile if you're interested in learning more about me. I added a bunch of crap about myself, because obviously, if you're reading my blog, you just  love  to bore yourself to death. Ciao.",7
"Current Song: ""Buy Me a Condo,"" Weird Al    Yes, that's right. Tonight, after finishing up our work on Sandwich Quest, Mr. Ravager asked for a screenshot of our work. I sent him a demo instead. When he was finished, this exchange occured.  ElRavager5: ::potential tunes begin coursing through brain:: I it's kewl with you, I'd like to try some concept BG-music... RenoSix: Wait. You mean you're willing to compose for us? Or am I just hallucinating? ElRavager5: I'd be delighted to. It's already very funny, and I'd love to try and come up with a corresponding soundtrack. RenoSix: Whooooa. This is quite a shock, as Mewd and I were just discussing how we wish we could have original music. ElRavager5: Yeah, I'd love compose for it. Most of my recent stuff has been incredibly intense, moody, and atmospherically dark. It would be a great change to do something in the humorous category.  This  rocks.  We were needing a composer. We don't like strangers. El Ravager is no stranger. This rocks.  I can't get over it. We have a team. Team. Team, team. Teaaaaam. Team. TEAM! team. Teeeeeeeaaaaaaaammmmmmmmmmm... teamteam. Team. Team. 4:41am. Team.  I love the sound of that. Not just ""Mewd and Reno,"" we're now ""The Sandwich Quest Team."" It has such a ring. The Sandwich Quest Team. The Team. Team. Teaaaaaaaaam.  That's all I have to say, though. I'm so happy. We have a composer now! And things are going so swell. Why, so swell, I think I'll post another random chat excerpt. Enjoy!  Mewd6 wants to send file 1-1.wma.  RenoSix: What is it from? Mewd6: Brandenburg Concerto for four Harpsichords, Strings, and Continuo one, movement one.  RenoSix: Ah yes.  Okay, okay,  two!  You earned it. Pat yourself on the back.  Mewd6: Roar. I am Metal Gear Samanatha. Cower before me puny mortal and tremble before my fearsome roar.",7
"Current Song: ""Sweating Bullets,"" Megadeth    I changed my layout again. Tee hee. (Remind me to never say ""Tee hee"" again. Ever.)  Tee hee.  (Ah, crap.)  Let the blogging commence. Lost the old layout. It was starting to rust, and I had to let it soak in the bathtub. I have this odd feeling that my weblog is not at all exciting. There are interesting ones, like  urlLink ToastyFrog  and  urlLink that one that Al Lowe linked to in today's CyberJoke 3000  (Top Ten Worst Album Covers Ever. Devastatin' Dave...  yikes ). Then, there are boring ones, like  urlLink mine . What gives? Why isn't my weblog cool?  I asked a team of real scientific analysts why my blog isn't cool. After much heavy debate and research, not to mention a flat rate of $24.95, they presented me with a fifteen-page report, containing 8,000 words and four charts. Never one for reading, I leafed through it carelessly and came upon one single line that I think sums it all up perfectly.   Your blog, unlike Explosive Mandolin, has no zany, random chat excerpts.   Well, if it's excerpts the people want, it's excerpts they get!  RenoSix: I need to have a random conversation for my blog, any ideas? Ducktor Schmitty: tuna RenoSix: TUNA  My blog just got 21.2% cooler.        And now, for another installment of THRILLING ADVENTURE CORNER!!!1!.   I just  HAD  to write about this. Thrilling adventure always makes for great content.  Earlier, while laying the smackdown on Don Flemenco for the second time in Punch-Out!!, I saw a little figure wobbling by my mouse. A little figure that turned out to be a small roach. Now, we don't get many roaches here. In fact, I've only killed one or two. It wasn't a hollywood cockroach, but a little one that resembled a beetle. They come around every now and then to harass me. I'm sure your house has them somewhere, too. Creepy, huh? Anyway.  I told Mewd about it. He stuck beside me on my quest to find the little turd and maim it. I couldn't find it -- exposure to the light caused it to fritter away at a lightning-fast speed, and when I chased it down with my intense, heavy-duty flashlight beam, it took cover off the computer desk.  I vowed to kill it before the night was up.  Well, just now I was admiring my new blog layout and name, I caught out of the corner of my eye, a little figure crawling up the lamp stand. I muttered a few unkind words, spun around, grabbed the flyswatter, and did another 180 turn to the lamp. It was out of sight, on the other side of the pole. So I struck the lamp to catch the little creep's attention. It frittered around, completely unaware that I'm right handed and I had a perfect swing range. I brought down the flyswatter on that waste of life and drew the flyswatter back victoriously. I think it fell down into my fan and got diced by the blades.  Flippin' insect's got nothin' on me.",7

"Current  Song:  Video thinger: Weird Al interviewing Eminem   And now, a dramatic reenactment. Playing the part of Eminem, El Ravager. Playing the part of Weird Al, Reno.

"Current Song: ""Breathe,"" Pink Floyd     Breathe. Breathe in the air. Don't be afraid to care.   Why am I posting this? I dunno. I suppose just reading about  urlLink Vivendi firing off 350 employees and, effectively, Sierra , has brought back a sour taste of Chainsaw Monday. Not that I care if Sierra dies, mind you. No, it's already dead. Here's my post at the QFG forum, last chance to see me there so get it while you can:   I'm not that sad if Sierra disappears. Sierra disappeared five years ago. They're not the same anymore and have no value to me. It doesn't matter if Sierra falls off the map; they're not Sierra anymore, just a bunch of suits with a name that commits blasphemy against a proud legacy. It shames me to see the brand on the dozens of mediocre titles they've put out in the past few years.   Though if the forum falls, that IS a pity. I grew up here.   Aaaand I'll just paste in what I told Mewd to end this entry. Screw Sierra. Screw Vivendi. Screw everybody but Blizzard. Feed Blizzard grapes and give them a private harem. But screw Vivendi.",7
"Current Song: ""Stuck in a Closet with Vanna White,"" Weird Al    I can officially say that it is our anniversary. Yes, it's past midnight, which means it's now June 23rd. I've been with Jessie for a year. I still remember this day a year ago -- how anxious I was, and how we were kept waiting even longer when her mom and brother were over and taking forever to leave. But it's  really  hard to believe that it's already been a year. Still, it's been a very, very happy year, chock full of romantic moments -- like when my ceiling started leaking in the middle of the night while I was playing Gabriel Knight 1. Oh, or how about when she fell asleep while online and I panicked for half an hour when she wouldn't respond to anything I did? And I'll never forget the time I called her at 5:30 in the morning, apologizing for hanging up on her, when we'd actually gotten off the phone an hour and a half earlier. (Okay, well, that was just funny. I will admit.)  Still, though... a year. I love her very much, and am really thankful to have such a wonderful girlfriend. But enough smarm! This is a weblog. There'll be no mushiness here! Let's cleanse your palate with a random chat excerpt.  MW Expert Lud: Then I challenge you to a duel of honor! RenoSix: I'd rather have a dual of puns. It's triple the excitement, and quads of fun. MW Expert Lud: Hmm... I accept your duel. RenoSix: I hope you realize who you're dealing with. My puns have roots in all of Europe, even Tree Lanka. I have branched out all over the world, and have even had my photosynthesis taken with celebritrees. MW Expert Lud: Well, umm... darn... RenoSix: It's okay if you can't defeet me. I toed you that I was quite a phalange. MW Expert Lud: LOL RenoSix: *twirls moustache*  I played through Quest for Glory 3 last night. I haven't played it in years, yet I finished it from start to finish in a sitting. Deathfoot is now in Mordavia, mingling with the townsfolk and listening to Igor's droll graveyard humor. I'm looking forward to finally playing through Quest for Glory 4, after finally  urlLink defeating the numerous timer errors.   It's 5:50. Why am I still awake? Have a good day, and remember: if you're not in Rav's last will and testament, you're not a popular kid.",7
"Current Song: ""Masquerade,"" Symphony X     First off, apologies to all who did not see me online tonight (last night? I dunno, it is presently 6:30am). I spent six and a half hours on the phone with Jessie tonight (huzzah for 'free nights and weekends'), mostly playing GK3, partly chatting. We decided to ditch our 'competition' and, instead, play the game moreso 'together.' She restored to where I was and we started going through together. Granted, we're now sharing our progress with each other and helping each other out, but this is something we've always wanted to do -- play an adventure game together -- and GK3 gives us a great chance. We're restricting ourselves to only playing while on the phone; I still haven't caught up to her 480pts, but I'm well on my way -- I think we're around 430. Day 2, 5pm - 10pm. It's really getting good, I must say, though awfully creepy. SPOILER:  Man, Prince James' agents being murdered was a huge surprise. Jess and I both have theories about what happened. Jeez, that word really gets around in this game -- theory.  There, no eyes harmed who haven't played the game. Just highlight that huuuuge blank space for things not fit for print.  More cool blank space!  Aside from GK3 and QFG5 (whom I have been neglecting, I'm sorry, Silmaria), I can't say things have been at their hottest lately. I've been reading The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy a  LOT  lately. I haven't read it in years, and it's really great stuff. I'm already halfway through the first book in the trilogy (note: yes, Jessie, a trilogy *can* have five books. You're just anal, that's all.) and it hasn't slowed down yet. I'm rather enjoying the book -- and why shouldn't I? It's the Hitchhiker's Guide!  I  have  been in the midst of a problem. A crisis of sorts if you want to get melodramatic. I spoke with Rav about it... two nights ago was it? I don't remember, these summer days are a blur. Anyway, this has really suddenly sprung up, and I don't like it. It's an old fear of mine, really, and it's been stuck on me for as long as I can remember. (I'm not stalling or setting up for some big comedic joke, just giving you some backstory. Like you care.) I've always been afraid of turning eighteen; not because that's when I 'start' on my life or because I go out on my own or because of college or anything like that. I must admit, to all of you who I've mentioned my fears of getting older -- I've been feeding you a white lie this whole time. No, the real reason I'm so anxious and restless about turning eighteen, despite it being nine months away, is because I've always had a fear, a phobia if you will, of being drafted into the Army. Silly, isn't it? That's what I've convinced myself, but I'm afraid that with our recent war thing and all, by April of '05 they'll be needing to recruit more soldiers and thus, will delve into America's lazy, Gen-X youth.  I know, it's a very silly thing to worry over, as there hasn't been a draft for a long, long time. It's just that, well, I've always had a feeling that by the time I turn eighteen they'll be in a war and in need of more support. Jessie insists that I have nothing to worry about, and Rav doubts I need to be concerned. The rest of you I've been silent about my problem to, either because you won't care or because I don't want to bugger you with my petty worries because I've thrown my burdens onto you one-too-many times (this only applies to one of you and  urlLink you know who you are ). I just... I really don't know. I don't know what to make of my worries. The one thing I've been dreading more than anything all of my life is conscription into the military. I mean it. If it wasn't for that, I'd be perfectly secure in my future. To be honest, though? I think this is God's way of convincing me that I need to attend college.  I've shrugged it off with many, many petty excuses -- I don't need it. I can't afford it. I can live without it. I don't want to go to school for another four years. Every time I make one of these stupid, insignificant excuses, I cringe and realize that I'm stalling. God knows this. He knows my problems and struggles. He's also guiding me through them. I have no excuse against college anymore, and I know it. I'm no longer going to reply ""College? Nah."" It's college all the way for me. I really do need it, despite my reluctance, and it'll excuse me from being drafted. I don't know if I'll be able to afford it, but there are grants and student loans. God'll protect me. I know it. Why should I have any reason to fear? Really, why? The hand of God is covering me and shielding me; His gift of everlasting love, peace and grace is plentiful and mine for the taking, so why should I hold back? It's like the old hymn; ""What a friend we have in Jesus, all our sins and grieves to bear...""  Anyway, I don't want to get overly zealous here -- and I have some reading to do. All of you, I'll talk to you tomorrow. Pray for my peace. The more I write and think about my discussion with Jessie over the topic, the more rest and ease I feel. How great God is.",7

"Current Song: ""Valley of the Damned,"" Dragonforce    Well, blogheads, things haven't been at their height lately. I was going strong with rapid updates for a while, but I've sorta dropped off the map for a few days. Why? Read on and find out.  First, I should probably explain my last entry -- things are really hectic with Jessie. I won't go into details out of respect for her and her family, but, well, let's put it this way -- her grandma, after some really unfortunate consequences, is barely hanging on to life. She was bleeding internally, and, while she was given a month, she's barely lasted a few days after they discovered it. Jessie's been really strong, though, and I'm proud of her.  This has caused quite a bit of unrest and grief -- so much that progress on Sandwich Quest has halted temporarily. Well, I can't pin it all on the morbid situation in Indiana -- Mewd's been having some awful connection problems and I went onto a Quest for Glory kick the night I mentioned beating QFG3. I beat QFG4 the other night, though, for the first time ever, and am now on QFG5. Deathfoot the Wizard is on the third Rite of Rulership, and has plans to defeat the vile Hydra once and for all! Or not.  Also: I started up Gabriel Knight 3 the other night, and have since been juggling between Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned and Dragon Fire. Man, GK3 is one tough adventure game. For all you sports fans keeping tabs at home (read: 0), I'm on Day 1, 12pm - 2pm. I was stuck for a couple nights (mornings? What a schedule) in the first time block, but I  finally  managed to trigger the next one. I'm having a good time, though. GK3 isn't nearly as bad as I expected gameplay-wise. The camera gimmick takes some getting used to, but it works very well. I'm content with it, and having a blast. It's really amazing the amount of true history that Jane Jensen incorporated into the game; I never thought France could be so interesting. And it's even moreso intriguing that Rennes le Chateau is a real place. And I'll admit, Tim Curry isn't too bad as Gabriel... but  Dean Erickson is still the real Gabriel Knight.  I insist on it. Mewd, Rav, you can say what you want.  By the way, check this out:  urlLink Andy Kaufman Returns   This fellow imitates Andy Kaufman for a big elaborate hoax stating that he's really alive and never died of cancer.

I was burning up (why did I put on a blanket with furface lying against my legs and no fan on? Gee I'm dumb) and had a stomachache. A removal of all things blankety and a quick trip into the bathroom relieved my troubles, so I settled back onto the mattress. At around 4, I had enough of lying around and got some apple pie. I ate, drank, and got back into bed. Nothing. Finally, around 5:30, I drifted for about twenty minutes (I don't remember what episode of Cheers it was, so I must've slept), then woke up. I turned off the TV after Nick at Nite went off the air and decided to try listening to my GK3 soundtrack to calm my nerves.  I got through it one and a half times before deciding that enough was enough. I got up, thoroughly angry, and plopped onto the couch. It was there on the couch, with cat cuddled to my chest, that I decided: I'm going to call Dad at about 8 and ask him to pick me up at 12 instead of 9. I need the sleep, man... I NEED THE SLEEP! Holy crap, I am so out of it, but I have insomnia! I have flippin' insomnia! I am extremely tired. I can feel myself flop down into any chair, bed, or couch I sit in. I'm barely aware of what I'm doing. I don't know what to do! I tried everything. I mean, EVERYTHING. I even counted sheep. You heard me -- I counted sheep. As a testament to how tired and barely focused I am, I went from 59 to 100 before realizing that I accidentally gave 60 a miss, then later on, counted from one hundred twenty-nine to one hundred twenty-ten. Come on, look at me! I'm a mess!  But I can't sleep!    urlLink Curse you, Neptune!   Blarg. I'm going to play TimeSplitters 2 while I wait for mom to come home so I can call Dad. I need sleep. I need it baaaad. Hmm, I also need breakfast. Maybe I'll get some.",7
"Current Song: Gabriel Knight 3 soundtrack    Yeah, finished GK3 the other night (July 7). Jessie and I both played to completion together, from 480 points to the bitter end. Not in one night, mind you, but it wasn't until around 480 that we decided to team up and tackle it together rather than compete. The game was VERY good, though frustrating often. There were a couple of creepy parts --  like exploring Montreaux's attic, and seeing Mallory and McDoogal slain on the rocks, not to mention seeing those visions and the pools of blood by every murder scene  -- but you know, overall, the game wasn't so bad. I'd say that GK2 probably creeped me out more, maybe because of the fact that FMV gaming lends to realism. But I have to say,  Le Serpent Rouge is incredible.  Man, I feel bad for all you people avoiding the spoilers because you can't play the game. You must think there's something really, really interesting in there, but you can't bear to highlight the text and read it! By the way,  this isn't actually a spoiler, but I feel like being a jerk.  Wasn't that part GREAT!? I totally didn't see it coming!  Yes, yes. Enough on GK3. I actually started writing this post an hour ago, but then I started to get sidetracked reading  urlLink How Much is Inside  at  urlLink Cockeyed.com . Great, great website. It looks like the inspiration from another old favorite of mine,  urlLink AllTooFlat . Pick one and go to it. No, in fact, go to both! You owe it to yourself to  at least  check out ATF's Lion and Crossing Man pranks, and Cockeyed's Paparazzi halloween costume. Science geeks can be fun!  Startlingly bad transition from humorous to serious topics!: Jessie's grandmother passed away on July 3rd. This afternoon marked the funeral. Thanks to all my blog readers, gullible as you are for actually buying into this whole ""Ric's life"" thing, that prayed for her and remembered her family. She appreciates it very much. I would say more, but as before, I'll keep it at that out of respect.  So I'm going to dad's house tomorrow morning. This is not good. I love my dad and enjoy visiting, but...  I have to get up at 8:30.  What am I, insane? 8:30? No, no, completely true. It sucketh. BUT! I can manage. By the time I get home on Sunday, Rav's package, chock full of all the Weird Al CDs I could ever want, will have arrived, and I'll be basking in the glory of CDs-I-currently-only-have-on-cassette. Man, cassette sucks. This is especially for you, cassette nerds: your medium sucks! Aahahaha! L0sers! LOL n00bs!  Also -- ""Weird Al"" Yankovic - The Ultimate Video Collection rocks. This is all I can say about such a breathtaking masterpiece of stereophonic sound spectacular.  Anyway, before I go and end this blog entry, a crime scene revealed its ugly head the other day and I need your help in discovering the hideout of the perp. I was here at the computer, minding my own business, when I looked over, and, well... it's gruesome, but... here's what I saw.       If anybody has any ideas as to the whereabouts of this vicious killer knife, Henry the Hellbleeder, please disclose all tips and tricks to me. Murderers of innocent aluminum must be stopped!   Isn't that little supernova flashy effect on the blade cool? I did that myself.",7

"Current Song: ""Mr. Popeil,"" Weird Al      And now, for another installment of THRILLING ADVENTURE CORNER!!!1!.   I was lying in bed last night (this morning?) when I realized that I hadn't written about this in my last post, so I have to do it now. So I was on the phone with The Rav last night when I glanced over and saw a roach climbing the privacy curtain on my door. He was of a good size, and ON MY FRICKIN' DOOR.  Now, naturally, when I see one of these buggers, I tend to shoot my glance around my immediate area to find something that suits the slaughter. I was about to grab my mouse's wrist pad to crush him, but then I saw him: Henry the Hell-Bleeder.  Despite his controversy in the vicious murder of those Mountain Dew cans, Henry's not a bad guy. Sure, he tends to be dangerous, and, actually, quite sharp, but he's used his amazing superpowers for good before. In fact, a nice example of this is last night. Funny story: I actually had to pull the impaled can off of his blade because it had been on there ever since snapping the photo. Okay, it wasn't that funny.  So I grab Henry, explaining to Rav the direness of my situation. Then, wielding Henry in my right hand, I slashed at the beast. Several times. Let me tell you, I put medieval knights to shame. Actually, I think it's more like: I give medieval knights shame. I missed. Many times. In fact, I think the roach was more afraid of the thunderous crash of steel on door rather than the impending doom of a sharpened blade swinging above its doomed person. It scampered about worriedly, always in the opposite direction of the last place I lowered the knife. Finally, the shockwaves dislodged it from the curtain and the creep fell to the floor. Mr. Rav witnessed my cunning fumbling tendancies with a sharp object as I sliced time after time at the roach, eventually crippling it. Henry tasted blood as he made a nice, clean laceration through the center of the bug. It was quite a sight.  Of course, the insect was still wriggling, and now it was on the toe of one of my slippers. I didn't want it to get away. It had already almost scampered to safety upon plummeting to the ground, and I wasn't about to mark this down as a missed opportunity to actually kill something with my dagger. So rather than swipe and slash blindly and risk ruining my slipper, I angled the blade and smushed that sucker with the side. Let me tell you, I've never been happier to see roach entrails. Henry was victorious! Viva la revolucion!",7
"Current Song: ""Gotta Boogie,"" Weird Al    Technical date: 7/13 Renoish date: 7/12  Hey, sports fans, welcome to the weblog. Today's been a solidly awesome day. You know how I can prove this? When I woke up, there was a cold Coke in the fridge. You know how long it's been since I've had a real Coke? Nearly two months. I had one at my rich uncle's house, but oddly -- and I'm not exaggerating -- the Coke they have there always, ALWAYS tastes Diet. I think it has to do with the fact that he has more money than humanly necessary. You know how I can prove THIS? He has eleven bathrooms.  If I'm exaggerating, it's only barely.  So after inhaling the Excellent Soda Coke (Double Fine fans, accept this generous injoke), I went on to enjoy a way-cool day. You heard me -- way-cool. I phoned up my buddy Rav and proceeded to make his ears bleed for five hours. That was a lot of fun. I've never, EVER taken part of that many Weird Al references via voice. Heck, I think our back and forth reference-battling has even toppled our online reference-battling. Ah, well, what can I say? I'm just Such a Groovy Guy. If you don't agree with me, tough -- Everything You Know Is Wrong. I would stop my incessant referecing, but why should I stop now? Look, I'll Be Mellow When I'm Dead. Maybe I'm just a Couch Potato, but you can stop me by watching The Brady Bunch. Come on, I Can't Watch This! It saddens me that they even bothered putting it on Cable TV, let alone let the entire block watch it on Frank's 2000"" TV. For what it's worth, maybe I'm just Addicted to Spuds, but that's what happens when you're Young, Dumb and Ugly -- you tend to Dare to be Stupid and use Ebay even more than Eddie Vedder. Oh crap, Why Does This Always Happen to Me? I'm on a tangent. I'd better stop before I start talking about how It's All About the Pentiums.  El Ravager now hates me.   And this is at 8:30 in the morning!   (By the way, speaking of, my visit with Dad went just dandily. I called, left a message on his voice mail, then held my breath as I waited for his return phone call. He ended up returning at noon, just as I requested -- I then went and fixed his computer, then spent a wonderfully listless night trying to sleep on the couch, waking up every hour to another rerun of Full House. But his computer is mostly fixed! It still freezes horribly, sadly, but I worked around this problem by installing  urlLink Mozilla Firefox  on his computer instead of Internet Explorer. Seems there's a bug in IE or something that's causing a huge conflict with his computer, because when I cut off its circulation, freezing was no longer an issue. Oh well, Firefox rules anyway. But other than that, everything's awesome and spiffy on his PC. Sucky thing. Don't buy anything from Hewlett Packard unless it's a printer.)",7

"Current Song: ""I Hate Everything,"" George Strait    Got office chair?  urlLink I sure do.   So Blogger has this new WYSIWYG bit. I don't know how much I like it. I mean, it's actually really great, because it allows for people without much experience to edit their weblog without needing to know HTML (read: wimps). But I demand hardcode-ability! I'm an HTML veteran, I don't need these easy versions. I type out my code by hand! I'm a MAN! Woof! Grrr!  Right. Lessee, I should probably tell you that last week I went to my Uncle's house for two nights and had a blast. Wings and steak by day, movies and popcorn by night. Watched the western  Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia  Thursday night and  Rocky IV  Friday night. Both really good movies. (Great, my dog just got up and tossed her cookies for no apparent reason. And we're out of paper towels.) Other'n that, we had a lot of fun. Lots of good conversation, and I managed to fix all their computer problems for them. I r00lz.  Man, I wish we had some paper towels.  Hmm, let's see, other than that... oh, we went to the library the other day. That was great. I picked up a whole lotta cool stuff. *'s next to things I needed for research for my newest novel (i.e. it was either a book on the 40's or a film noir).   Books:    The Age of Doubt: American Thought and Culture in the 1940's*      DVDs:    The Man Who Wasn't There*   The Third Man*   Monty Python's Life of Brian   Big Trouble   Office Space      VHS:    Touch of Evil*   The Big Sleep*   Detour*   Monty Python's Flying Circus vol3     Exciting, huh?! Yeah, I know, you're thrilled. The story's doing well, of course, though I need to finish up the plot. It'll probably be set around 1948... good old fashioned film noir detective story. No, not a Sherlock Holmes-esque bit, I'm talking  film noir.  Black film. Struggling private eyes, seductive femme fatales, crooked cops, shady characters, underhanded criminals,  blackmail  whitefemale*, betrayal, disguise, and deceit -- the works, baby. Best kind of movie out there if you ask me. A rainy night, a down-on-his-luck private dick, a damsel with a request, a twisted world where nothing is what you think it is... ohhh yeah, my kind of story. It's a thrill to be writing one of these.  By the way, I've only watched The Man Who Wasn't There and The Third Man since my trip to the library on Wednesday. The Third Man is a classic noir -- wonderful, wonderful story and dialogue and whatnot. I'd seen it before, and so I knew what to expect, but the DVD was remastered and all that and presented a brilliant reparation of the old film. I wouldn't mind owning that movie, to be honest. The Man Who Wasn't There was disappointing. I mean, it was a great movie, but some of Billy Bob Thornton's acting was overdone (he was supposed to play a quiet barber, but he played a TOO quiet, wooden barber), and a few sequences were rushed. Awesome twist at the end, though. This movie was the perfect example of the essence of noir: a sneaky proposition, a risky chance, and from there, a downhill mudslide. I felt very bad for Ed Crane: he only wanted an escape from the mundane, but a few baaad decisions made his life turn upside down and then fed it to a kraken. Like I said, it's really a great movie and I have nothing against it -- but I was expecting a lot more than what was presented to me. My expectations WERE rather high, though.  Anyhow, I'm off now. Mewd is typing something, and I don't know what it is. Wait, no, he sent the IM. Nevermind. G'night, folks! Don't go jumping into any spider webs or getting your limbs deattached by a sneaky government contract.   *Inside joke that you won't understand unless your name backwards is regavar le.",7

"MOPSY 1 	Wandering aimlessly seems to be a thing of pleasure for her, these days. Marianne’s sense of romance lets her connect collapsing in a graceful pool of cloak and limbs with skinning the soles of her feet on a hot sidewalk, and getting one more concussion from fainting along the way. Her hallucinations and the wild heat aid her. She smiles faintly when I struggle to pick her up, fluttering her hand at me as if to say she cannot do it herself, but that it is not worth the trouble. I think she is worth the trouble, and know she tries not to grunt when I put her across my shoulders and carry her home. Sometimes the walk home is very long, and I see that it is a large distance she has walked. Then, there are more and more frequent pauses as I stop to catch my breath, and listen for her slow breathing. Sometimes she has only just made it around the corner of our street, and then I turn around to see the curtains falling back down, the neighbors pretending not to have been watching. I would not look at them if I was Marianne, but I think she does. I think Marianne sees a lot of things I would not want to see if I were her. 	When she is back on the drooping couch, she does not look at me. I intend to fix the sofa; I will give it proper cushions with full ends and upholstery that doesn’t remind us of nineteen eighty-two. I will take away the brown-flowered curtains in her bedroom, and find clean white ones to go in their stead. The rugs should not be faded, the bed should not sag and creak the way it does, and there should be neither linoleum nor a plastic table cover in the kitchen. Marianne never thought that being an invalid would mean old red and green and beige and pale blue flowered sheets to hide the stains from when she could not keep herself from coughing in the night. She did not think there would be coughing in the day, too, and that some of it would be done in bed. I never (have never, do never, will never) ask her why she walks barefoot out the door sometimes, so long that I must go find her. I would not want to sleep on a tired, springy bed with stained sheets either. I do anyway. 	Finally, Marianne looks up at me from the couch. I am sitting in the armchair across the room, watching her and waiting for the present moment. She wants to ask me what we shall do this afternoon. Anything you like, I can say, giving her the decision. She will not be able to make up her mind, and we will turn the cushions backward on the sofa to redistribute the old fluff inside. There will not be anything worth watching on the TV, and we will be admittedly too lazy to pull out a CD player, so we will just sit. My arm goes around her shoulders, she slouches against me, and everything is just the way it ought to be. I will have to push her away, then, because her skin is too hot and I am afraid that I will begin to burn if she does not let go of me soon.  	Sitting on the sofa this way will only make new sofa memories over the old ones, and I do not want to revise the past. I will not suggest or move or even look to sitting with my arm around her on the left and left-middle gap cushions because I remember when her skin was cool. She did not cough so very much then (and coughing rubbish up was rare). Marianne and I are quite well matched, I think. The neighbors say so, and they laugh. Mr. and Mrs. Chotky have their prejudice intact (Marianne sees them and smiles all the same), but I happen to know that Marianne is not going to ask me what to do this afternoon because she does not want me to pull away from her. She knows what I am thinking. This is good. Even fevered people can be soul mates. Even fevered people can read minds, if they could before. 	There are many things that Marianne can do, these days. She can walk half a mile, in shoes, without fainting. She can, usually, dress herself. She can manage our calendar; every so often she will update it with colored crayons to mark the days in which we will go to a park or a museum or Ikea to sit on the furniture. I am teaching her to make pancakes from the bag, and she is teaching me to bake brownies from the box. Sometimes she has trouble with the flipping and the mixing, but that is why I am here. My arms are fairly strong, she says, though my culinary genius does not yet extend beyond pre-packaged food. I try not to remember that she does not have the energy to stand and work for longer than it takes to make boxed brownies. She particularly likes the interval between opening the box and eating the brownies, when she can watch me become befuddled and laugh. You’re learning, she says, you have to be the one to sort the process out. I laugh too, of course, and if the brownies are miserable because I forgot the yoghurt this time, we laugh again. She can laugh a lot, these days. 	One day, I bring her a book that I have bought in the subway station on the way home from work. I have a part-time job in an architect’s office as a kind of gopher, only they pay me more because they know my girl is terminally ill. We deny that it is terminal, but accept the money anyway. Perhaps someday I’ll get a real job there, and move up the totem pole? Twenty-six and I’m only starting off. I think we’ll be okay. Marianne protests that she is not okay- She does not really want the book I brought today, or the cards from yesterday, or the disposable camera from the day before. She wants me home, of course, she wants to be well again, and she wants a bottle of Lysol to clean her sheets with. I tell her that she might not want Lysol for her sheets, but she is adamant.  	In the end, we strip the bed and dunk the sheets in Clorox. We soak and drown and inundate the sheets with Clorox. [The sheets] are now slightly closer to white than they were before, but have mostly faded into beige. She is begging me for brooms, for vacuums, which we have, and for heavy duty window cleaner and ammonia based cleaning products, which we haven’t. Formula 409, while probably toxic, does not smell the same way ammonia does. It is also advertised as biodegradable, and I thus see it as a good investment. Marianne does not think that Formula 409 will rid her house of the old invalid smell. Twenty-six and this is how it ends, she says. Then she looks at me solemnly, and points out in all seriousness that she intends to scrub her soul of disease with ammonia. I do not want to laugh, because she may honestly intend to wash herself with floor cleaner, and if I laugh she will swallow it just to spite me. This must be stopped. I snort accidentally, in the effort to breathe calmly through my nose. Again, I snort a little, and my mouth is twitching, so is hers, she is laughing a little, then I am, and then we both are, as ever. Marianne flips to the first page of the book I have given her and shows me that a) it is a romance novel, and b) the main character is intending to scrub her soul with something or other. She had begun reading while I was searching for Clorox, and found it devilishly amusing. I begin to wonder if she is honestly as tired of living in a sick house as I am, or if she’s only made that up to use a line. Shame upon me, because of course she’s tired of living here; Marianne is here more often than I am. Marianne is always here. 	On Saturday morning, I make a feeble attempt to sleep past nine. I do not like venturing into the real world at 6:45 daily to make money- some days I am still a teenager. Marianne is a teenager too. 8:45 AM and she is sitting on my bed, considering shaking me awake, considering staring at me until I wake up, considering doing neither, and finally just staring out of sheer nervousness that I might die if she shakes me too hard. You are fragile, she says. I wake up, of course, and ask her if I have kicked her in the night. You are fragile, I say. Then I want to kick myself, because of course she has her own room, own bed, now, with Clorox-ed sheets. I must kick myself again and again, to remember that I am not going to forget sleeping with her nearby when her skin felt white and her rubbish landed in the pot by her pillow. It is all right, of course; a slip of the tongue at 8:45 is forgiven by her because we are going to make pancakes again. She will be a fast learner and a fast talker when she gets tired. Marianne has stopped getting cranky when she is tired. She is tired often, I think. 	When we are getting ready for bed, Marianne often sits on the bathtub ledge to watch me brush my teeth. She is very philosophical, then. You know, she says, having toothpaste on your nose is like having banana on your chin. Here, I want to laugh, but doing so while brushing my teeth opens my mouth dangerously wide. I think that’s why she says the things she does, to see toothpaste dribble out of the corner of my usually neat mouth. She strikes me as so young, then, or at least so fun. It’s funny that you connect the two, she says. Twenty-six and that’s just where we are, love, twenty-six. She pauses, and I stare at the mirror, brushing heartily away; thinking. I can’t say I’ve learned something from her. There is no lesson from her sickness, and I don’t want there to be; lessons mean closure, and we’re not finished yet. We’re going to make her well, we’re going to move across the country, and we’re going to be young and beautiful doing it. I grin, and lose a little toothpaste out the side of my mouth. I think we’ll be fine, I say. Twenty-six is a good place for us.",8

"Edge-of-Jungle Scene 	It is late afternoon, and the smaller animals are gravitating towards the watering hole. Its uneven blackness spans a large area, with a graying log floating in the center. The animals appear to avoid this potential resting spot in favor of hovering around the edges to drink and retreat into the shadows. More grey, ropey branches lie tangled across the surface of the water, from the fall of the central rotting trunk. The jungle populace holds its distance from these deadly cords, the nearest life form being a single toadstool growing in the shadows. An adventurous pale green frog has recently begun swimming near the opposite shore, but the others wait in the shadows for proof that the predators have already come and left.   Keyboard pad, keyboard, cords, paperclip bowl, post-it notes  	A large rock stands atop a nearby plateau, overlooking the watering hole. It has a smooth, thin surface, with a blackness that the pond reflects. A frequent origin of strange noises, only the tiniest and bravest of creatures seek protection here- purple speckled tree frog of the same species as the pale green swimmer, and a colony of white moths.  Computer monitor, post-its, business cards  	Off to the leftmost side of the pond, after a safe space of red earth (trampled into circles and ovals by the larger animals), a large sloth has emerged to hydrate itself. The sloth is of a very light grey, and has not moved for at least twenty minutes. It is difficult to discern which end is its head and which its tail. Neither end nor sides produces limbs of any kind. Breathing is also not visible, but it is expected that it will soon ‘awaken’ to drink and slink away. This manner of appearing dead or inanimate is a defense mechanism of the grey Jungle Sloth. Cashmere sweater 	Tree branches swing low by the right side of the water. On top of these sit a variety of birds, possibly unsure as to whether the fallen tree branches are snakes or plants. One bird, a deep brown creature of the Armanus family, has opened his wings silently, revealing tan wingtips to indicate that his status as a male of mating age. He sits triumphantly atop a red jungle worm that he has crushed into submission. It no longer struggles for freedom.  Armani glasses case, red CD case  	Behind this more colorful bird sit a collection of oddly shaped birds. The first two are crows, one starved and gaunt, and the other with a tumor on his rear end such that he appears curved up at each end. Their black feathers are no longer shiny, perhaps indicating a flight across the desert to the edge of the jungle, here. They, too, await the clearing of the watering hole. Next to these two characters sits a black vulture with a particularly bulbous head, which he swings at random moments so as to inspire fear into the sloth and the other faking-death animals. However, his possession of a bit of still-red rhinoceros carcass indicates that he is no longer on the hunt. At his side is the last crow, with longer feathers than the others, looking particularly mild for the hot weather. A cool breeze blows in, and the purple speckled frog leaps into the watering hole.

"Today,....... hmmm. What to say about today, and whatever else has happened since my last post. I cant say anything here that would make up for whatever it is that ive done in the period of time prior to this entry. Im not going to call attention to anything that is particularly depressing tonight. Im done with that. Im not going to let myself feel guilty for something that i 'did' that doesnt require an action. I apologize, but i wont let myself feel bad. Thats the way ive decided i want to live my life, and thats how i will. Anyways, Neal and I took Emily out for lunch today as a late birthday lunch. We partook in various Italian festivities while dining at Joe's, and somehow started the day long conversation of ""What are cars named after?"" What in the hell is an Alero? Montero? Vue? Nobody knows. Anyways, after lunch, we all rode in Neal's car to Baskin Robbins, because 1) Emily wanted to go there, and 2) She didnt want to drive in the 'rain'. When we arrived, we deliberated upon which flavor of ice cream we wished to consume. Since im boring, and according to them, i like no food, ever, (but i am a fan of racism and Nazi's appearantly...), that i decided to just stick with the cookie's and cream. They on the other hand had to take the purity and wonder that is ice cream, and crush it beneath neal's (terribly clothed) legs of justice. They decided to buy "" X-MINT."" Some lame flavor to celebrate a far more amazing piece of cinematography. Ok, here's putting it lightly. It was the most unappetizing looking substance in the history of mankind. It was black, yes black, tar black even, and a dark blue. It looked like bubblegum on black top. Disgusting. So of course, they eat it, completely content that im totally and entirely disgusted by it, and then we decide to go roaming. The first stop, ""  Cascades...."" (in a whisper). Then around the Krispy Kreme parking lot. We saw a lot of nice houses, we gawked, and continued wondering what car names meant. Is a Grand Cherokee a really really really awesome Native American? Anyways, Emily had to go to work, so Neal came over and hung out for a while. We did nothing. For an excrutiatingly long period of time. Then Neal wanted to set up my bench press rack thing, which then involved rearranging my entire game room in order to do so. With that finished, and the clock reaching 9:30, Neal decided he was hungry, so he left. I didnt eat. James came home from Las Vegas later, and brought me some stuff. I smiled, its awesome stuff. And now im here, talking to my cousin from California online. Its been a great day, a simply fantasmic day. Nothing can bother me as of this moment. Oh yea, and Jeff didnt come to my house at 12:45 to get some blank cds without his parents knowing on a bike, in case you were wondering if anything of the sort occurred, because it didnt. Well, im done typing useless banter for now, ill probably resume that task later...  Song of the Day: A Beautiful Day, by U2 Quote of the Day: ""What in the hell is an Accord?"" Neal...",9
"Well, today wasnt very exciting. My mom had a root canal today, so, to put it lightly, she's not in the best of moods. She's not pissy or anything, just in pain, and i cant blame her. Anything that has to do with teeth is pretty much unjustifiable by medicinal reasons, and is almost always unbearable. Ive been trying to help her out all day. It made me really realize how much she does around the house, its crazy. I love my mother, as do most of my friends. She's adopted half of them, and she's always so cool about having people hang out over here. She's the coolest. Anyways, i was listening to music, (quietly), and just decided to download the most random stuff ever. Stuff that would irritate the hell out of most people. Can anyone say, ""Im a punk rocker..""? Ugh... Yea, she dont know no David Bowie, no Sex Piestols, she's like 17, they're like 100. Anyways, i was listening to one of Avril's songs, and i just kinda noticed how during parts of the song, she sounds just like Ashley Elgie. Im serious. Listen to ""Im with you"", (for as long as you can stand it), and think about how Ashley sounds, its like exactly the same. Anyways, we didnt end up getting any pictures of Toby and his yellow diaper of justice, i wish we wouldve, but the memories will last forever. Haha, still funny... Oh yea, Michael and Jeff came over the day before yesterday, we hung out, it was pretty cool. Michael and I got pissed that Jeff was so good at Clone Wars, i was about to strangle the kid. We were P-I-S-E-D...... Pised? Im taking Emily out for her birthday tomorrow for lunch, anywhere she wants. She's not doing a good job deciding where she wants to go though. Hmmm, i played some more Metroid Prime today. Im still afraid of Meta-Ridley. Im pretty much afraid of that whole game, i dont really know why, cause its not scary. Ill probably try and finish it tomorrow. After lunch, if Emily ever makes up her mind. Jeff leaves friday, ill have another less person to talk to/hang out with, itll be sad. Meh, he'll have a good time in the north. I talked to a girl that i like today, we're gonna hang out some day next week. She's gonna stop by after she gets done doing her extensive cross country mandatory workout. Hopefully itll be a good time and i wont just be retarded.   Im feeling unusually content right now. Pretty much everybody i know, or care about at the moment, is happy. Its awesome how summer does that to people. My views on unhappy people are that they shouldnt keep hanging out with people that: A) Make them unhappy, or B)Are also unhappy. Im in a great mood, i have plans to do stuff this week and weekend. Itll be a good time. Haha, south park is a funny show, i just remembered a quote from the episode, ""Asspen"". A ski instructor was telling the boys how to ski, and he used the pizza and french fries analogy. ""If you pizza when you shouldve french fried, you're gonna have a bad time. If you forget to pizza, you're gonna have a bad time."" ""When are we supposed to be having a good time?"" Haha, download it, its priceless. U2 is one of the greatest bands of all the world. I hope Bono beats out the Pope for the Nobel Peace Prize. Haha. Also, you should listen to the solo that Mista Martinez wants me to play, its not possible. Carnival of Venice is the name of Satan himself. Download, and begin to cry immediately. Anyways, im done doing my rambling for the night.

"Happy Birthday to Shauna!!!!!!! Oh, and by the way, what happened yesterday, all that talk, i was just in an extremely bad mood. Don't worry or anything, its all good. I had a lesson today, i sucked. Maybe i should practice...... I did get to see Mr. M's braces though. You can't even see them practically, its not fair. Anyways, im better than him at the moment, it made me smile. Anyways, people are coming over to hang out tonight, and my family is now gone. Hooray! If you want to hang out, just show up, its all good. It'll be a fun time. Tell Shauna Happy Birthday, or else. Ill update again later, with something happier, i promise.

"I am a selfish, heartless, proud, independent bastard. Its official. I think ive managed to piss every last one of my friends off in the past month. I love the fact that i dont know what im doing to anybody either. I pissed off jacob earlier, i dont know how or why, i was reading what he was saying, trying to really absorb it, and i was doing other things, like check and write e-mail, and he gets all angry because i didnt respond or anything or whatever. I dont know, i dont even know who im typing this to. I dont have any friends who read this anyways. So its just me, feeling sorry for myself as usual, but of course, i wont burden you with my problems, heaven forbid that i concern you with anything that has to do with my god forsaken life. I really do admire jacob for trying to help me tonight, trying to convince me im no burden, but if im not, then why did he get offline in a rage. I want to know the logic behind that one. I wonder if i have any sharp knives in my house... My head still hurts. I wish i could make somebody happy. Just at least one person, thats all i want. To make somebody truly happy for once. I want to be able to make somebody cry or pass out, or faint, or just fall over giddy in glee and joy. I could care less how i feel at that moment, but i just want somebody to be happy by my hands. Maybe Jacob is right, maybe i should open up more. But then again, what is this, pretty much open to me. Its not like i expect anybody to solve my problems. Thats the reason for why i dont even ask for help. I wonder why i feel the way i do sometimes. At least everybody else pretends they're happy most of the time. I was told tonight that i scare a lot of my friends, and that i make people worry. I feel awful. My head hurts, maybe ill do something to stop the pain....",9
"Yep, im in a super terrible mood/mindset today. I just feel like ""whats the point"". A friend of mine, who's been very awesome to me lately, summed it up well. He said i was apathetic, and i replied by saying that caring about everything has brought me this far, why not try a change. He knows me so well, he knows my feelings, he knows what kind of person i am, and i wonder how he knew that stuff while i sit here confused as to why i cant even bring myself to go up stairs like normal people, or stop counting things. I've had a lot of headaches lately. I've been around too many people and heard too many thoughts the past couple of days. My head hurts now. You wouldnt understand what its like to have to focus on what you are thinking about personally. Nevermind, i dont want to get into that. My problem is that i care about people, and i dont want them to care too much about me. I feel bad when i tell people my problems, because i dont want to cause any distraction in their life by forcing them to concern themselves with mine. I feel bad for making people talk to me about my problems because i know that whatever is bothering me has affected somebody else too. My head hurts. If you were here right now, i would know what you thought of this, and i would also know how confused you were while you read. Maybe ill tell you if you ask me what this means, but you wont believe me, its stupid to me. Im glad i have good friends, 2 mainly who both stayed up late to talk to me even though they have drumline camp tomorrow. I appreciate people, i just dont know why they appreciate me so much. My head hurts.   Song of the Day: Cross My Heart, by The Rocket Summer Quote of the Day: Any of the humorous things i felt or heard from people ive been around all weekend.

"I leave today for my family reunion. Hooray... Meh, itll be alright. My family isnt as dysfunctional as some. It'll be a good time. Well, ill need to hang out with people upon my return, so keep your schedules open. I wont be online, or updating for a couple of days... and ill be bored. But, hopefully, my family will keep my occupied and in a good mood. Im happy now, i dont want that to stop.  Song of the Day: Die Another Day, by Madonna Quote of the Day: ""Can you say banana?""

"Family! So many family members here today. Kinda a good time most of the time, but there's always the down bringers. The baby is cute, but its louder than Coach Horton, (if you remember him), and enjoys screaming, kicking, and breaking things. My cousins from California came down too, they're super awesome, and so ""hip"", (there's that word again), cause they live near Hollywood... or not so much the hipness. Meh, either way, it was a good time, much fun was had by all. My friends are still great, i just feel terrible for not being able to see Emily on her big day of birth. Most of the people i know are happy at this moment, which in turn makes me ecstatic. I feel great when everyone around me feels good. I could most of the time care less whats going on in my own life as long as the people i care for are alright. Wow, Conan was freakin hilarious tonight, haha, Wrist Hulk, haha, so funny. There's not a whole lot on my mind tonight. Im not still laughing right now, because toby got his diaper off, and we didnt get any pictures, sadly enough. I got to bed at 6:30 AM last night, and got up at 10, so needless to say, im a tid bit on the tired side, so ill probably get going soon.

"I just got done talking to Ryan. He's an amazing guy that one. We talked for hours on end about everything. Im considering him one of my great friends now, because he's done so much for me. I feel great now, probably primarily because i talked to him, and even started to open up about things that i normally try to avoid. I feel indebted to him because of the impact he's had on my life so far. Anyways, its early/late, and im in a fantastic mood. Just thought id write something out. I wonder if anybody is reading this. But thanks Ryan, you're awesome.",9
"Wow, its been an exciting night. You have no idea. Ok, so, i hang out all day, doing nothing, cousins are on their way, and my family has ordered pizza. While we all eagerly await our nourishment, (not so much me, because my teeth hurt like no other), we see a car pull up in front of our house. Excited that we now have food, my family gets up off of their butts, (hard to do), and go look outside, and who other than Mrs. Peek walks to the door. After talking to Kacy's mom for a little while, (who is a pretty hip and cool person, thats right, i said hip), we go back inside to continue waiting for pizza. When our pizza finally arrives, (which is hand tossed, which we all dislike), we eat, and then begin a whole new round of waiting, this time for our cousins. After they arrive, and exchange hugs and news from our lives, we hear the pleasant sound of children crying and dogs yelping. Oh yes, how pleasantly relaxing it was. Anyways, Toby, (my dog), returns from meeting the DOBERMAN that lives down the street, with a big happy giddy BLOODY smile. So we pack him up in towels and throw him in the car and head out for a vet that is open at 9 PM. After locating one, we go inside, toby dripping everywhere and I without shoes, to see the doctor, who by some odd chance of luck and amusement, has a MULLET, multi-colored frog scrubs, and an earring on his left ear. Many laughs i had in the car on the way home. Anyways, after Toby got his 3 staples for his LACERATION, and a big stupidly hilarious looking yellow diaper for his punctures, (haha, so funny looking), we returned home, where Toby then does not move after being placed on the ground again. He doesnt move at all, not even a step, its so funny. And now im here, still laughing at Toby's rediculous diaper. Haha, you have to see it, ill take pictures. Anyways, thats all for today, im done, and thats the extent of my day.",9
"Hmm, thought for the day, i need to do something with my hair, it needs a change. I know i promised somebody that i would grow it out, but im just looking for an idea of what to do. Give me some suggestions, or else you'll be forced to look at the terrible mess on top of my neck, (no, not my face, there's nothing i can do about that). Tell me what i should do. My cousins come in from Lubbock, yes the huge famous exciting fast paced headlining city of Lubbock, today and they are some of my favorite relatives. All of my favorites live far away, i wonder if thats a coincidence... Anyways, im looking forward to seeing them. You should stop by and meet them, they're awesome, and they have a baby and a really awesome daughter. If you stop by, it might also give them the illusion that i have friends, haha. Anyways, i just felt like posting something, oh, and funny thing said today...  ""HopeToBeAnAggie: i wasnt trying to kill you hotstuff793: i know HopeToBeAnAggie: i just hit you in the face with a pool toy, and almost drowned you hotstuff793: LOL HopeToBeAnAggie: that's not attempted homicide HopeToBeAnAggie: just being really mean""  Yep, Cassie's great, if you disagree, i dont care, she's cool to me. If you get a personal quote in here, it means something, so feel proud if you do. Hooray for family reunions this weekend... oh wait, no. SO MANY SMALL CHILDREN. Im not a big fan of the tiny children, but whatever, its only for like 2 days. Well, im out of things to say, may post something later after day 1 of being with Rusty and Mindy, (thats my cousins names by the way).

"A New Look on Life  So i've decided to start a blog. I dont care if anybody reads this, im only doing this for me. I've been thinking a lot, about many things, mainly my friends. I have the greatest friends. The most impactful lately have been my newest aquaintances. The people ive met, and gotten to know have given me so much without asking anything in return, and i feel so lucky to have them, even if i do sometimes do something stupid, like walk home, or hit them in the face with a pool toy, or talk to them late late late into the morning while they try to work on spanish projects. Anyways, if you're reading this, you probably already know me, and you know how i am to you. Im trying to change who i am, im trying to feel happier, feel more free. Im too paranoid about how people think of me, or how they feel at a certain moment in time. I know ive asked everyone reading this at least once if im bothering them, or if im annoying them in some way, and im trying to make that stop, because one of my friends, a great one in fact brought to light how freakin annoying that is. Needless to say, that will stop, at all costs. I also am going to try to think more about myself, not selfishly or egotistically, but more along the lines of getting to know who i am, what im good at, what im not, and learning to accept, and actually get to the point of knowing and enjoying who i am. My other concern in my life right now is that ill never experience love. Its silly to think that now, being only 16 years, 1 month, and 24 days into my life, but regardless of that fact, i feel like im missing out on a lot. My parents tell me such great stories of how their high school sweet hearts brought them such joy, and how it helped them learn and grow as a person. I want to feel that, i want to know that, i want to be able to tell my kids about it. Many of you wont, and probably never will understand how i feel, but i appreciate those of you who have at least tried.   Anyways, off that topic, i had the opportunity to hang out with some of my favorite people today. Kacy Peek, Jordan Peek, Neal LeBlanc, Cassie Cervenka, Allison Bennet, Brittany Payne, and Emily Hahn. They are wonderful, simply amazing. This summer so far would have been total crap if it wasnt for them. Also, ive gotten to talk to a bunch of new people online, and otherwise, you know who you are, but meh. Friends are great, have some, if you dont, you're a loser, and you should get some. Hmmm, what else to write, this is a first entry after all, so im not sure. Everybody else writes such beautiful things in their journals. Meh. This isnt for the enjoyment of others after all, i am pretty much talking to myself here. Kinda like how Emily says everything she types aloud when she's on AIM. Haha, good times.  Might as well end it with something cliché. Song of the Day: Tomorrow by SR-71 Quote of the Day: ""I like to take the jello powder, and just drop water on it to make little gel droplets.""

"MARCHING PRACTICE TOMORROW! Kill me now. It was 101 at 7:00 PM today! I cant wait to sign my 3rd contract selling away my soul which forbids me to do/think/be anything but band. It wont be awful. Ill see people. The freshman will be there......... Ill see people, that at least is good. Maybe that girl who flirted blatantly x4 towards me has calmed down. I hope so. Or maybe i dont. I dont know, i guess im desperate. I dont think ill have many plans for the next couple of months, which is kinda depressing, but school wont be so bad. We always make school seem like Hell during the summer. It is sometimes, but half the time you're having fun. ................... ""And now, the Keller High School Band, performing their show............. STARS!!!!!"" Oh geez. I cant wait........ This show has to be better than the show with the Japanese techno we played while forming 'elemental' shapes on a football field. It must be better. It cant not be better. But geez, stars. Why couldnt it have been like, ""And now, the Keller High School Band, performing their show, The Legend of Zelda!"" or, ""Star Wars"" if you really wanted to keep some of the 'stars' effect. I would be all for that, just give me some awesome music, something ill recognize thats catchy and most likely not playable, and im set. You know what would be a great show, a Lord of the Rings show, like where some special color guard people could be the fellowship and such, and some could be orcs and elves and men and dwarves, (sadly to say, id be recruited as a freakin dwarf), but i would really like to be a Ring Wraith. There's nothing cooler than that. Nobody would be allowed to be Legolas, cause then they'd be perfect, and then everybody would hate them. Anyways, im just trying to distract myself from 'stars' for a little while by making up entire different shows. But whats sadder, is that im distracting myself from marching with other marching. Impressive, i know. Im ludicrously bored. I wish i could think of something inspiring or deep to say. But thats it, ^, right up there. Im not too clever as of today. People came over last night, it was fun. Thats it. Im about done. Actually i am. Finished. Fin.  Quote of the Day: ""Yea, my dog of 17 years died"" ""  You're   kidding!""

"Hmmm. Im not deserving of this life im given. Im wasting this gift by making bad choices and doing wrongs to my 'friends'. The mere fact that i have friends still puzzles me. The fact that they read this, and ask me if im alright is something that i dont understand. Why do they care, why does it matter to them that i feel the way i do. I dont understand what makes them worry or what makes them fret over the bendable words that are written out in this journal. Why does it interest people to delve into my life, as they attempt to understand how i 'tick'. I hate clocks, but i love noise. Time isnt real. I hate the fact that people think you can travel through time, or stop time. Time is just a way to keep track of the decay of carbon based life forms. If you could go back in time, then whenever you accomplished what you set out to do would be completed in the future, and you would have no reason to go back in the first place. If you stopped time, everything would stop moving. Even atoms, hence, you would be imprisoned in a motionless universe. You would suffocate because you wouldnt be able to breathe, better yet move at all. And if you could go into the future, to see what will come to pass, you would then realize that whatever you did in the present didnt matter, because regardless of the 'choices' you would make, it would all lead to the future you saw, leaving you to wonder if you are actually living your life at all, or if you are just a puppet being dragged along by the ever present flow of time. You wouldnt have control of your destiny. Anyways, ive been wondering why i put my 'friends' in the awkward and often times bothersome positions i put them in. I know what causes it, but i cant help it. I need to do these things. But i hate that i cant fulfill that need without hurting someone close to me. I wonder how the lives of my friends would be different, mostly i think of how they would be better if we never had met. How the experiences and provocations i put them through have altered their lives, and how they would be if i had never done those things. I also wonder if when i die, that perhaps the world ceases to exist. That maybe, this world, is dependent on my existence, that the people i know, the places i see are all parts of me, and that when i come to the end of my life, that maybe this world stops. Maybe this world would just vanish, disappear, or if it would just carry on like it seems to when anybody dies. I cant see through somebody else's conciousness, which is why i think that maybe the things i see are here for me, and made by me. Its foolish. I wonder what the world   would be like if i werent alive tomorrow. I wonder if anyone would notice, and if they noticed if they would care, and if they cared if they would remember, and if they remembered would they mourn. If the world keeps spinning after i die, then i wonder what the point of it all was. Ive made little positive impact on the lives of others. I wish i was a better friend. I wish that i am a better friend. I wish that i will be a better friend. If i could, i would go back and fix my mistakes, if i could i would stop the world spinning so i could end the mistakes im making, and if i could i would go to the future and see how ive grown. But i cant. Im here now, only now, never anywhere else. I may never be as good as i think i need to be to completely fulfill what is deserved of my friends as a person, but perhaps ill reach something that is close. Im sorry to those of you who ive made uncomfortable, those of you ive made worry, those of you who ive forced conversation out of. I apologize, it wont happen again. Ill see to that. Time. Time marches on. Time sucks ass. There's not enough time in the world to describe how much my 'friends' mean to me. Not enough time to tell them that they've done too much. Not enough time to let them know how sorry i am. Either way, its time for me to stop. Its time to better myself. And its time for change.  Song of the Day: Time of Your Life, Green Day Quote of the Day: ""(Silence of sleep)""",9
"The human thought. Always around, ever flowing, constantly inter-twining, filling our temporary filing cabinets with every scrap of information we gather throughout the day. Thoughts are merely images, sounds, ideas, feelings we experience, which are then brought back, and shown to us again as memories. Ghosts of what was, these memories dance inside our heads, keeping the past alive inside, and allowing us to taste what once was, and what has occured throughout our time, our story, that masterpiece of existence that is created by every person on Earth. The quick fleeting glances and shocks of thoughts that race throughout our psyche every moment of our days are all laced together in one fashion or the next. Some think of the mind as a web, or a net, something usually designed for ensnaring something. I think of it as a strand or a beam. Something that begins but does not necessarily end in an exact place. If you've ever sat down, and actually thought about thought, either when you try to remember how you got to the place you are now, and where you started from, you'll realize that everything you ponder is somehow linked, not necesarily intricated with something else, but loosely connected to another. A single word in a quote, or on a sign you recollect may send your thought process onto a whole other current, leading you to something completely different, or perhaps something remarkably similar. In any case, the human brain is exquisite. Any tool that lets something gracefully transition from one thing to the next without the realization of effort, or connection is truly amazing. Something that i believe influences a person's train of thought, quite often de-railing it from its previous track, is music. Music can change a person's entire mood, straight from melancholy to joyous, or from ecstatic to dismal. The melodic anomaly found in everyday sounds and jingles has an effect on people. Traffic noises, sad songs on the radio, crying babies. Anything obnoxious, or unenjoyable can cause a sudden and drastic change in a persons overall demeanor. But mainly, the way a person speaks often tells the listener how the intricate workings of someones mind is functioning. You can fake it all you want, but the tone and texture of the sound flowing from your lips gives it away. The eyes and face help marginally, but the chords of words, or shaky replies more than likely rat out the inner most divinations of the brain. Thinking is so simple, but figuring is difficult. If one is required to solve a problem which hasnt been presented before, the brain must leave all casual thought astray and focus on a single dilema. More often than not, this leads to stress, due to the over exertion of the mind, and the lack of freedom and happiness brought by free thought. The looseness of our thoughts keeps us sane, keeps us happy and relaxed. When a person is resting, they arent focused on something, they're more than likely not thinking about anything in particular, which eases the heart, and nurtures the spirit. Thought. Think about it.   In summation to all of what was just written, whenever you feel stressed, dont just 'relax'. Let your mind wander from the problem for a while, allow your brain to relax. Its not a physical problem as much as it is a mental one. Just think.

"Envy. Lately ive been consumed by it. The want, the urge, no, the need to have what others have, to be as good or better than someone else. Not ambition, not duty, but jealousy and envy. My favorite color always has been green, its really quite ironic. I find myself everyday wishing that i could switch lives/bodies/personalities with my friends and family. To know what its like to be them, to be better than i am, or so i see it. Im not really good at believing in myself, no, its not a strong suit of mine. Im not real big on pride. Thats at least one deadly sin i wont have to worry about. But then again, im not a real good person to refer to on sins. Anyways, i feel jealous, i feel full of want and desire. Desire for something i can never have, its impossible. A desire that will destroy me inside if i dont do anything about it. I must travel to the fires of mount doom..... oh wait, i got a little carried away. Then again, this will be a quest, a personal quest where i must learn to accept myself, and cast Tnilc Nesnah's Bane into the fires. Satron will not take me with his 7, the Singuls, i will carry on. Wow, its early in the morning, im acting stupid. So much Lord of the Rings. I feel so cool, not like a nerd at all, i promise. Anyways, im bored, its time to sleep. Its time to go into the Emerald Dream, and think of things that have not yet come to pass....",9
"Yea, its been a while. I dont really care at the moment. At this moment, i just want everybody to know that im extremely happy with most of my friends. And the others, well, they can go straight to a place thats not Heaven. The only reason being is that people randomly get pissed off at me, or have a problem with me, or are annoyed by me, and dont tell me. People block me, then say they didnt block me because they were mad at me, or had a problem with me. What other reason is there, ""Oh, well, i just felt like i needed to block somebody, so i sat down, put everybody's name in a hat, and drew yours, thats my reasoning. Whoops, sorry."" Yea, its kinda like that. Im not really mad, just confused, i am completely and totally content with my other friends. Jeffrey is back in town, which is cool, Jacob is not, he's on a 2 week cruise of the Meditteranean with his ""poor as dirt on the cheek of a homeless mans face"" family, and many others are yet unacounted for because either they dont call anybody, sleep all day, or are just at home, doing nothing (like me), and arent really in my mind to mention at the moment. I feel kind of rushed right now, rushed for what, who knows, ive been like this a lot lately. My head doesnt hurt. Which is good. Weird stuff isnt happening, which is good. Ive had the chance to hang out with friends, which is good. But i still feel frantic. I know i need to start my summer reading, but i have way too much time for that. Im still applying for a job, and yea, i know i can get one. Its not really an immediate deadline or anything that im concerned with. Its more like a countdown. It might be the countdown to when i graduate, the fact that i might not see some of my best friends ever again. Maybe its the fact that there's been a lot going on in my life, nothing huge, but lots of little things that make me realize that growing up isnt going to be just big huge bundles of 100% grade A quality fun. Money, relationships, work, insurance, bills, credit cards, check books, house payments, car payments, jury duty, parking tickets, heart disease, alzheimers, coffin shopping, will writing. Not a whole lot of that sounds fun to me, so i guess im just feeling frantic because i know my 'childhood', 'youth', 'teenage years', wont last that much longer. Its just a race towards 40. Wow, i dont want to be that old, but yea, i dont want to not make it there either. I dont know really, i feel rushed, but im not doing anything. Ive been sitting around, not really thinking a whole lot, just passing the days. They're going by fast, just like the last 2 years of my life. I cant recall my first day of high school, or the first time i met, or saw some of my current upperclassmen friends of today. My life is a blur, which is natural. Im just weird, i remember really stupid stuff. i remember breaking a glass dish in the kitchen of the first house i lived in when i was 5. I remember hiding under my bed the first time my step dad, ( in that time, only my mothers boyfriend), came to visit. I remember my first bike ride, and how i ran into a station wagon across the street. I remember swimming lessons, oh lord swimming lessons. Im still wondering how that water wasnt boiling, seeing as the DEVIL was the swim instructor. I remember he wouldnt let me out of the pool until i did what he instructed me to, which of course included using the facilities. So naturally, being like 6, i had very poor control over my bodily functions. Enough said. I remember my first pet, my first dog. And for the more uncommon memories, i remember sitting next to a girl in Kindergarten who would always say, ""Move it or lose it."" I was terrified of that girl. I remember eating lunch with my teacher in a courtyard in 2nd grade because it was a reward in our class, she always brought a huge huge lunch, like steak and fruit, and the best freaking cheesecake ive ever had. I remember the first time I met the girl i would be in love with for 3 years of my life. She knows who she is, and you probably do too. So many memories, but so many lost. I can remember things vaguely, great times i had, but dont immediately recall. I guess i just hope that the things i do now, this year, this high school experience wont end up totally like that. I hope that when i am 40, (eww), that ill remember my friends, and maybe even call them up every so often. I hope that a lot of things happen, i should stop. Things dont get done just from hoping, so i need to take action more often. I feel ok. I am ok. I just am confused as to why im in a hurry, and why my friends dont tell me whats bothering them. Thats all ive got for now. Im gonna go do nothing, and still be rushed.  Song of the Day: Nightingale, Saves the Day Quote of the Day: ""Go Cavs Fo Sheezy"", Cassie and Emily",9
"Yea, so its been a while. Its only been a while because ive had to reload my entire computer. Its been a good time. Might as well get this out of the way.  I Freakin Hate Physics!!!  Ok, thats out of my system. Well, ive changed myself for the better. Some of my dearest friends brought to my attention that ive been an ass many times before, so im working on changing that. No more whining or despairing for me. Im going to enjoy life for once. Yep. Anyways, im listening to amazing music, i know it sounds lame, but its orchestrated music, but nothing puts me in a better mood than a simply stunningly arranged piece of music.

Cassie, Emily, Valary, Espi, Natalie, Ashely, Kacy, Casey, Brittany, Whitney, Cheri, that kinda works, i dont know, im stretching now. Eh, there's not a whole lot on my mind. Oh yea, Katie. Ah, Katie. Yea, so ive been seeing some of the people that i used to be bestest friends with a lot more lately. Its awesome, like Megan Starkey, we were the greatest of friends back in the day. Maybe we'll get like that again. I havent been seeing Amanda as much anymore, i havent seen her at school not even one time. We'll hang out soon hopefully. People are coming to watch movies tonight, it should be enjoyable. Cassie's been bugging me about this stupid thing, so i figured i might as well find it, and then update it. So here it is.

"Hmm, this weekend was great. The parties were fun, especially the horn party. And this weekend not a whole lot happened. Oh yea, there is that one thing. My great aunt gave me her car. Its not cool at all, its a 1992 chevrolet caprice, but its free, and the insurance is like only $100 dollars, and there's nothing really wrong with it. So im not complaining, and my parents say if i can take care of it, and keep a job, 'they'll see what they can do' about a new car. So yea, its pretty cool. Im trying to make the car as stupid as possible, complete with fuzzy dice, beads, maybe some fringe, maybe some of those beaded seat covers. I dont know, stuff like that. And ive named it Remy Lebeau, because its burgundy colored, it has the fuzzy dice, and because its just a cool name. Anyways, its a pretty cool thing, but yea, the car isnt cool at all. It has a V8, which is nice, but other than that, wow. Hmmm, i really want a different car, but this one is free, and it might lead to a new awesome car down the road.

But the most surprising thing of the day, is that Mrs. Casey was actually pretty cool. Hard to believe, i know, but she was nice, and she joked around. Its insane. The first day of W.E. was alright, it still feels weird saying that. We played through the first movement, it sounded alright, we need some serious work though. Today at practice, we had a kid come that had never been at practice before, so i had to teach him everything we've learned in the short time of an hour and a half. He might be ready for the audition, but honestly, i highly doubt it. Well, i was going to hang out with kacy today, but i never heard from her, turns out she was just out later than she thought. Anyway, auditions are tomorrow, im really worried about making it.............. Well, i got no sleep last night, i finished my homework, and ive had dinner, so i think ill just hang out, maybe work out or something, or maybe call up a friend. Meh, its all cool.

"The sun has just set, leaving tinges of purple and indigo spread thin across the night sky. A mournful finality grips the land as another day dies and passes on, while a promise of a new day chases the emotions created by the waxing moon and gently sparkling stars. The cosmic events leading up to a sunset are incredible. As the earth gently glides throughout the universe, making slow revolutions around our most familiar star, the people living upon it never question or ponder what exactly is occuring in order to allow them to live their lives, see their family, be with friends, or to just be alive at all. People rely on the days to pass, even though they complain about how time flies. Sunsets are romantic, they bring people joy and despair at the same time. Darkness without light is frightening, but a midnight with a loved one is anything but. The pallet of colors cast brilliantly across the night sky as the sun grows dim is breathtaking. Pastels of life and love and happiness fill the minds of those who look upon the cascade of shades and hues on the horizon. A day without a sunset would be too depressing, if the day were as a light switch, simply from light to dark, then many would despair. Its the gentle transition from bright and luminous, to a serene and gentle canvas of violet that allows people to reflect, remember, and relax. A friend of mine gave me my inspiration through a beautiful image of such an event. Clouds cascading over one another as dancing rays of orange and red leaped across a lake. ""These are such things that dreams are made of,"" seems to sum it up well. I feel poetic, even though my ramblings often seem jumbled or muttled. I wish i was eloquent, worthy of remembrance for my oftentimes delusional literary creations. I have other talents in which to fall back on. Like speelling, and doing grammar good.   But yea, next time you see a sunset, think about what it means to you. Think of the people you've affected throughout the day, and dream about what could yet come to pass in the future. Imagine yourself at your greatest, and try with all your might to reach that point in the following day. Be great. Be amazing. Be who you are. Be.

"Tomorrow marks the day when CNN had the highest ratings of all television in the US. I know you've heard remarks about how you should think about how insignificant your problems are compared to what happened 2 years ago, but to me, (this may sound insensitive to many of you), but i think that people should really move on, and not dwell on things that have happened. Im not a big fan of reflection, but i think that rememberance is ok. I dont like putting emphasis on certain days, because then, that in turn almost forces people to think about the tragedy, and remember more than is necessary, and more often than not, memorial days cause victims to relive the trauma they endured. People should mourn, people should pray if you're into that, and people should remember, but people should move on, and maybe even someday learn to put the tragic thoughts away and every so often, think about it, without spending an entire day of memories and pain.   Anyways, im sad for what happened. Regardless of that, the incident didnt really cause any serious influence in my life. Nobody i knew died, nothing i owned was destroyed, and nobody i directly knew was hurt, physically or emotionally. I see tomorrow as a day for others. Forgive me if i dont cry, or ponder, but thats not the way i am. I dont fret over things that dont have impact on me. That's silly. The biggest problem in my life right now is Physics. I hate physics. Robots shouldnt teach.  Im going to miss seeing Cassie Cervenka every day. I hope she doesnt follow the trend of band drop outs and pretty much cease all communication and activity with me. But if she does, it would only be natural. I dont wonder why she quit, it doesnt matter to me. I hope she's happy with her decision, and i hope it works out for her.

Im glad for school. I dont want this year to end, because the seniors i have grown so close to will leave. I dont know what ill do. There's a big world outside of high school, i know, but right now, im in high school. Im still a part of this overly dramatic, frantic, ecstatic world. I hope i never leave, but, its inevitable. After KHS, i may never see the other members of the triumverate. But after all, people need to move on. We cant dwell in the past. But this is the present, and im diving in. Im swimming in the vast and brilliant life that im living, and enjoying every minute of it.   Tell me what i can do for you to possibly bring you to my level of bliss right now. Do it. Ill try and make you smile.  Quote of the Day: "" Clint!!!!   Emily!!!  Come on men! Lets head back to the showers, and get naked together since we're done tackling each other and rolling around on each other for hours on end!!!",9
"What dreams may come. I feel incredible today. Simply amazing. The day is bleak but my mood is bright. Today i feel as if my smile could break the cloudcover, releasing the entrapped sun and setting it free to beam down on others. I need a song, something ive only imagined, something ive dreamed of writing. Perhaps i might. Something with bold and easy transitions from favorite melodies and rythms of fantastic pieces mingled with a stunning harmony. Im fit to burst with happiness. I can guess as to why, but im not sure as to how. My friends are awesome. Just great. I wish i could say more, but the tiny clicks of the keys are feeding my need for music. I love the arts. Musical, cinematography, visual, anything. You name it. I dont know, this day is splendid. I need to share my joy with everyone i talk to today. It may be contagious.  Song of the Day: Only things that are created in the orquestra of my mind. Quote of the Day: ""Never give up."" from the movie, 'What Dreams May Come'",9
"The human emotion is a wretched wretched thing sometimes. The way the world can suddenly tear out the happiness and joy you were just in rapture with and twist and contort it into a completely opposite feeling is so destructive. An enlightenment, be it something really unpleasant to discover, hit me the other day. Its left me little to dwell on than itself. I find myself in a state of meloncholy and depression, as i long for something that i cant seem to grasp, despite the fact that many others  that i know can. Something that eludes me, taunts me, and kills me a little inside, every day. Maybe tomorrow will be different, but i cant see how. Maybe something will come to light, things will change, and all will be good in the world once more. The space that my friends fill is as big as ever, but the hole that they cant is growing. I need that sort of nourishment to be happy, and right now, i havent even had a taste of what i desire. Maybe tomorrow will be different. I sure as hell hope so. If not, things wont change, obviously. Maybe i can learn to cope, which is most likely, but maybe, ill keep dwelling on it. Hopefully not, but either way, its something that i have to do, myself. Nobody can really help, if i aksed, or if they wanted to. It doesnt work like that. I really dont know how it works, or even if anybody could understand this if they tried. Life is good. Friends are good. School is going as well as to be expected. But something still is missing. I wish i knew how to fill the void. Others can, so why cant i. Im only 16, i have the rest of my life, yea yea. But other 16 year olds, and then others that are younger are having no trouble it seems. I dont know, im rambling again. I just wish i didnt need to. This stupid journal has seemed to be somebody i can talk to. Somebody who wont judge me, or mock me. Somebody i dont have to worry about thinking differently of me, or pitying me, or laughing at me behind my back. If i only i could find somebody like this to help me fill the space. If only. Maybe tomorrow will be different.  Oh yea, and hey, if you're reading this, maybe people will like you more, or not talk bad about you behind your back, or act two faced towards you if you dont take people's pretzels, or stare at people because they're having a good time, or ask people to be quieter for no reason. Its just a suggestion. I guess i would be corrupted too if i dated somebody who looked like they just got back from a photo shoot for a gushers commercial.  No quotes worth putting. Song of the Day: Adagio for Strings, Jeff's right, it does own you.",9
"Friday, people are coming over, you should too if you want. If we're good enough friends, just come over and hang out, itll be a party. A big festive festival complete with all of the festivities usually associated with festivals of the festive variety. Yea, party, itll probably happen, and have movies and games and food and people and air and stuff. So come if you want. Or dont, it doesnt really matter, but ill be having fun.",9
"Ah, the journal. This simple expression of inner thought. I dont really understand the appeal of writing in it, but there is definately an appeal. I deleted the past 2 entries i wrote. I find them outdated and depressing. If you must see them, i might show them to you, but oh well, the past is the past. Im starting over, and i really like the way things are now. Im glad that the people that i call friends are such forgiving people, and are completely amazing for making their decision. But enough about the tedious workings of my life. I feel inspired. Again. This time not to write a masterpiece, or to talk about what i think, but to just write. To just say what will flow from my fingertips. To write what comes to my hands, as they glide across the wireless keyboard of my soul. I think its great that things are going well for everyone. Everyone, basically is happy, and thats with little exception for the first time in a while. I think its amazing that i can be with and around the people i am all the time. And i hope that i can bring somebody else that i think is really special into that group. Im glad that the sun rises every morning, and im glad that it will continue to do so even after im gone, (at least for the next 80 billion years...). But yea, high school is coming to a close for some of the fantastic people that i have become aquainted to, and i feel that i will miss them more than i think. It wont be keller without them, and it could quite possibly be more boring than ever. When people leave, this town dies a little. Its not a real town to me, its more like a collection. Its just a story of people. Its an anthology of lives. Nothing happens here, in this village, but there's always something to do. I find that fascinating. Ah, Toby is not rugged anymore, and my mom finished my blanket. Its really quite neat. Toby is clean, and i am warm, things are going well. I find that when i write for pleasure, its......... pleasureable, but when i write for zell, its....... not. I cant seem to express myself when i write for a prompt or an assignment. Here, i can say what i wish, without fear of grade or censor, and i dont have to worry about being ridiculed for my expression. Hmmm, i dont really have anything to write about, but just writing makes me smile. Smiling is good, and ive missed it.   Im making a cd for buddy, and i get an excuse to download some great music for her. I also made $100 for selling my old decrepit laptop. Today was good. I played computer games with jeff, and it took forever.   I feel fragmented, but then again, the passage of time this weekend has felt irregular. I wonder why. Maybe the planets are in alignment, or i can sense the leap day, but either way, i feel like ive been stretched. I like the feeling. I feel like there's more time. So im happy. Generally and genuinely happy. I talked to a cool kid the other night who said that he read this for a while, and that it moved him. I dont know if thats true or not, i dont see how it could be, i mean, im not that inspirational, but it prompted me to start this up again. Im not going to change the way i write, but im going to change my outlook.  Insight into my life is all that this offers to others, but to me, it offers an unquestioning ear. It offers understanding and comprehension of all my subtle metaphors, and all of my gentle allusions. I really think that i get too deep in it sometimes, Ms. Zell didnt catch them in my narrative. That made me sad, but im going to talk to her about it. She's going to let me try again. I just hope that ill get another muse. I loved that paper, but it was difficult to grasp. I understand that. Hmmm, maybe ill post it sometime. If anybody wants to see it. I havent had anybody read it but Ms. Zell, and myself, so, i guess it should be shared eventually.  I like long posts, but im surprised that you've stayed reading this far. Its just rambling above. But now i think ill say something meaningful. I think ill say that i enjoy it when my glass is full. I enjoy seeing things half full, even when its apparent that they're half empty. Deliriously oblivious, i have promenaded through the weeks, and made myself aquainted to the sounds of relaxation.   I hope to be trendy tomorrow, i hope to be stylish. Because Cassie and Emily helped me pick stuff out.   Listen to Hoobastank, ""The Reason"" ""You're like my inhaler, I just can't breathe without you.""  Thanks for the interest.",9
"I guess im just a hopeless romantic, but im growing weary of this loneliness. I thought i found somebody that i could confide in, but i was wrong i guess. I feel dumb for letting myself get down over stupid things like this. I feel ridiculous for getting upset for never being kissed. I feel like an 8 year old. I just want to experience what everyone else has. I want to 'fit in', yea, i want that, even though its 'evil' and 'pressuring', it still lets you relate. Being separated or segregated from a group in your head makes you feel differently. I had hope that things would change for a while. Turns out it was just my own naive ideals that crushed my hopes. I keep telling myself im doing something wrong. I keep telling myself that im not doing something right. I know thats wrong, but thats all I can determine. I want someone i can be close to. Someone i can be with and be comfortable. I want a person to know what im thinking, and to care about what i have to say. I want somebody who, when im talking, isnt just waiting for their turn to speak. I want somebody who gives up their turn to listen.  I want to be wanted.",9
"Hmmm, today was interesting. I was either heading to, or coming from, a PETsMART 8 times today. Toby needed a haircut, and now he looks goofy, so i had to drop him off, then come home, then go get him. Then, i was going to apply there with Emily, but she wasnt going to make the 1:00 time, so i was practically there, so i turned around and went to her house for a bit. Then we went to the post office, with the 1 human attendant, and mailed a piece of postage and spied an awesome little resturant. Afterward, we headed to a different PETsMART to finally apply at 2:00, and arrived at 1:50. Ok, here's where the fun starts.  Mr. Manager, (we never learn his name), greets us at the door after the cashier, (probably my future job if im accepted), calls for him, and he takes us back to the staff room thing to watch an awesome movie. The movie's first 20 seconds consist of the camera zooming in on the stupid ball that bounces off of the 's' on the PETsMART sign, which makes it lower case for some reason. The movie is really corny, and gives me the message that if you don't wear your name tag to work, you'll end up killing all of the hamsters or fish or something because 'if you dont complete all of your tasks here, you may be endangering the lives of pets.' Yea, so, i suppressed my laughter the best i could, (as did Emily), and i made it throught the video. Halfway through the video, at about 2:00 exactly, another applicant, we'll call him ""Late Guy"" walks in. Despite the fact that he's the only puntcual one of all 3 of us, he still appears late, which forces Mr. Manager to replay the video for him. The incesant smiling of the host guy in the video droned on in my head as i began to tackle the arduous task of compiling the huge sum of unnecessary information required for the completion of a gigantic application repeating over and over that, in simpler words, 'Drugs are bad, you'll get fired if you use drugs.'   Anyways, after the video and application phases, the next, more embarrassing part of the application process began. Mr. Manager took us one at a time into his office to ask us job-related questions. I, of course being the first to finish the application due to the time saved by avoiding having to write down any previous employment locations, was served first with a barrage of very vague and confusing questions/activities. I have hereby branded myself with the title, ""New Guy"", due to my lack of job experience. He takes me into his office, and the first words he says are, ""So, this could be your first job."" Wow, um, yea, it will be, and for the sake of it, we couldve stopped there probably. Oh no, the fun went on. Ok, here goes, tell me how you wouldve responded to this. ""OK, we're going to do some role-playing, ill be a customer, and you be the associate. I'm in the leash aisle, how would you approach me,"" says Mr. Manager. Hmmmm, uhhhh, hello sir, can i help you......? Anyways, you get the picture, it went on for a while, and i stumble through it, and he tells me what i couldve done better. Eh, more vague questions came afterward, i answered them with help from my encounters with some of Murtagh's questions, and did my best with those. Me, ""New Guy"", had finished.  Emily's turn comes. She says that she made herself sound really dumb. Mr. Manager seemed to have an extra skill in that area that few have. She says that she responded several times with phrases like, ""I love animals,"" or, ""I like rats and fish and....."" Yea, we all had a good laugh. It was quite funny. So then she labeled herself ""Ditsy Girl"". She had questions like, ""How would you rate teamwork on a scale of 1 to 10?"", and thats all. Its kinda like, ""Hmmm, lets see here, How? on a scale of 1 to 10."" So the questions were broad.  We both know ""Late Guy"" got a job, hands down. He seemed like he didnt give a damn, so he's in. But i think its a battle between ""I love animals,"" and ""I have no job experience."" I really dont know who will win. I mean, i might be shelling out change to people buying dog sweaters next week, who knows, or Emily might be working in the fish section, because she really doesnt want to work in the equine section at all. Eh, it was fun/hilarious, and afterward there was some good food. You should all go out and apply for random jobs. The only thing is, you might get one. Wouldnt that suck. Eww, work. The rest of the day consisted of usual teenage hanging out, and the watching of many music videos. All in all, a good day. Now, its getting kinda late, not really, but eh, and i need to decide which bed is closest and easiest to dive on to before i fall asleep in this chair. Im lazy, but maybe soon, a working man.

"Yea, spring break is almost upon us. I can practically smell it. I can taste the freedom, and i can hear the laughter that is approaching. The next 2 weeks should be good. Purely good. Only a few things are bothering me. Maybe just one, and it starts with ""M"" and ryhmes with Nurtagh. She gave us this enormous  ass ignment over the break. I really dont like that woman. But whatever, she wont ruin my break. Maybe ill figure out this person ive been so confused with. I hope so. Eh. Some things have been brewing for a while, and they finally erupted. Everybody knew they would, i just hope things are resolved quickly. My dad's house was really close to the area that the people on the news are talking about. The damaged houses on the news are about 5 miles from my dads house. I hope he's ok. I love my dad. A lot. He lives by the lake, a lake that should be visited by my friends this summer. Visited before they leave for college, or get ready for the upcoming school year. Yea, that'd be grand. I have to turn in my schedule tomorrow, but im afraid to take ""Adolf Whitler."" I really am afraid of that class. Im writing a definition paper for Zell that hopefully she wont despise like she has my others. Im really putting a lot of effort into it. I already have an outline, and i have planned to write a draft of it every 3 days. It will be excellent, or else. Im so tired of school right now. I have to study for Zell's test, because i need to do well to raise my terrible average. I need to do well so she will not hate me as much.   Alison Fudge, (a truly awesome chica), gave me a copy of her hoobastank cd. Ive listened to The Reason about 15 times in the past 2 days. Its so beautiful. Kinda reminds me of..... Anyways, i like it when it rains. I dont like walking in the rain with an umbrella, i feel like im trying to defy nature. I remember sprinting through the driving rain in florida with my friends last summer. Thats where i really got to know Emily and Cassie. They're really great friends. Truly great. Im glad i got to learn about them that trip, and i think it was an interesting experience with the whole extreme trouble action. Yay for hidden theme park attractions in Canada. With Canadians.  Yea, i think the rain is peaceful. Even if it is torrential. It washes my worries away. I feel like the rain fills that glass that people label optimists or pesimists with. It makes me optimistic. I look blindly at things, and always see hope when it rains. I love the rain. I wish i lived in seattle. Maybe not, but it was a thought.

"Sorry for not updating in forever, but Mrs. Zell has sapped any love of writing that i may have ever had from my body. I dont plan to write in here for a bit, so dont keep checking back, even though i know that pretty much nobody does, i mean seriously, its me rambling, why do you even look? Eh, stupid AP tests, stupid calculus, stupid powerpoints, stupid prompts. I do not like school, but yea, yay for really cool people, people who's birthdays are may 11th. Yay.

"I would like to request some inspiration, as odd as that sounds. I want to hear from people, their comments, opinions, anything, about anything. I would love to just take in their thoughts for a while, so i can try and unwind from my own anticipations and anxieties about life. I'm delieriously happy now, all the time. I love my friends so much, they are by far the most influential and wonderful parts of my life. I wake up everyday, and hope that i get to see them and talk and laugh like always. It fills me with glee to know that ill have at least one more summer with all of them, and I'm even more glad to get to know somebody i think is very special. Please, tell me what you're thinking. Tell me how you feel, and give me some insight into your life. I'll make this an ongoing thing, something that i believe can be something that i could be very proud of. I just really want to live with other people. I feel more alive when people are around, they complete my character and motivate my soul to shine.  Just talk. Release your thoughts through words. You dont have to partake in this excersise of communication, but if you have anything at all that you find interesting or important, please share. I think of this journal as something to help unleash my creativity from time to time. I love some of my previous entries more than anything ive written, because they're real. They're free-flowing thought, something that cant be taught or developed. It just occurs naturally and oftentimes results in some of the greatest art in the world. Think and speak and share and communicate, its the only way to introduce the world to the beauty of your life.  On a side note, I absolutely love Tina Fey, my car, dancing when nobody's watching, eating things that would make Dr. McReynolds cringe, being with my bestest of friends, making fun of dumb people, and realizing things about myself. I love these things. I love living so much, and have for a while now. Things used to be so different, but things change, like all things do. So i dont expect this bliss to be permanent by any means, but i do want to embrace it while i can. Tell me things you love. Off the wall things. Things you didnt even realize until you sat and thought about it. Just tell me.  I would like for this to become something amazing. Like a compilation or memoir of all the people i know. A literary memory of our friendships, regardless of how in depth they are. If you think this is stupid, tell me, thats still a thought, and still an opinion that should be expressed. I love long posts. I know somebody else who does also. They've told me so.  Summer should be tomorrow, it really should. Id get to experience so much more if i were free all the time. I want to learn so much. I want to see and taste and feel more this summer than any other, and i want it to last much much longer. I want to be with my seniors, the seniors ive grown so close to that i take for granted the pleasure of seeing and conversing with nearly everyday. But they're going through their own set of worries. College and what not, and the moving away ordeal. It must be hard. I really want them to be happy, they're amazing people. Meet them.   Let a stream of moonlight fill your sight with intuition, and let yourself foresee your own happiness. Bask in the rays of your own ecstasy and realize that you're living for you. Make a time be your own, and dont be afraid to embrace a moment. Take part of your life, and dont let it take control of you. You're in control of your own destiny, and the paths you take will lead you where you wanted to go. During your journey, keep gazing skyward, to remember the past, and look beyond to your future. Keep your spirits high, and raise those of others to your level whenever possible. I want to bottle some moonlight sometimes, just to shine on people when they're not as inspired as I.  If any of this makes sense to anybody, then im glad that somebody understands what im thinking. If not, then tell me your interpretation, its yet another form of expression, analyzation, and thought.  I really didnt expect to write anything tonight of any real significance, but now, im quite happy with whats come to me.  Listen to something that makes you smile. Recite a quote that makes you laugh. Live.  ~Clint",9
"Yay for good things. I got a new car. Come see it. I got a new X-Box. Come play it. And now i have a new outlook on life. Come meet me. New stuff, new friends, new opportunities.

"Hmmm, so im sitting here, thinking to myself, what is something interesting to put in here. Well, ive thought about it for a while, and had some okay ideas, so i think ill just start writing, and see what develops. Here goes...  I played freeze tag with small children a while back at my dad's house in Acton, Texas. Afterward, (several hours afterward i might add), i thought about how every step in human development has its own common desire. I became aware of the fact that kids do whatever is in their power to make games last forever. While playing freeze tag, the kids started cheating in order to keep the game going. I played freeze tag, as ""It"", for 2 hours straight without finishing a game. I came to the conclusion that the first stage of human life never wants the game to end. The game that is life. The unfolding adventure of each new day, and any misadventures that occur along the way.   Later, i realized that the second phase of development is the phase im currently a part of. The adolescent, pre-adulthood, teenage years. I know that all of us have thought about leaving our hometowns at least once a day, every day, for the past several years. How you'll miss your friends, the people you've spent your childhoods with, your favorite times together alongside, and your hardest times working through with. I read my last post just a moment ago, and saw how desperately i wanted to be done with school, but i remember, at the same time, i  dreaded the fact that it was another step in the direction of dispersion. The friends that i will inevitably part from, and yes, possibly forget one day, are what keep me sane and alive every day. I decided that teenagers never want their 'lives' to end. They never want to leave what they've grown so accustomed to, and what they seem to grow in to. The possibility of a different, possibly less pleasurable, possibly more difficult prospect of life after high school and college is something that people like me want to keep at bay. I want these years to never end.  Although i havent experienced the next phases myself, ive gathered enough experience with people of these classes to be able to formulate ideas on them. People in there twenties and thirties, for the sake of classification, lets call them 'youths' as it were, despite their age in comparison to my, or possibly your age, seem to treasure just that, their youth, above anything else. The ability to play, run, jump, drink, smoke, dive, swing, swim, and sex with no regard to the consequences is the drug of choice to the people in this class. The fact that their bodies are still capable of everything they could in the teen years, and the fact that they're adults and of expanded experience, creates something that is precious, a sort of limited opportunity for bliss. I see the main fear of these people as the process of aging. I think that the 'youths' never want their youth to end. They want to stay as virile and agile and mobile as they can for as long as they can. They want to stop the clock.  Mid-life crisis survivors and other middle aged people are the next classification. The fact that they're not a 'youth' anymore encroaches on their minds as their years accumulate. They buy expensive objects in hope of appeasing the need for their youthfulness, and explore new endeavors in hopes of drowning out the memories of their past. The inevitability of decrepitude begins to haunt their dreams. Middle-aged people never want their health to leave them. They want their youth returned, and their vigor restored. They want the clock to turn back.  The ancients, the elders, the decrepit, the geezers. They spend the rest of their days reflecting on their lives. Their experiences, their thoughts, their ideas, and their loves. They tell the youngsters stories of when they themselves were young, while often their tales fall on bored ears. The idea of youth is gone, and the fear of death and the realization that it could be close at hand is ever present. The elderly wish for their memories to sustain them, and their offspring to remember them. They want the clock to keep ticking.  I love writing, as you probably have guessed. But i also love feedback, be it positive or negative. I like to observe, i like to interact, and i like to experience. I wish i could say something deep in here, but i just write down what i feel.   I want to go see Dodgeball and Anchorman with somebody. They know who they are. I will break them out of their house if their parents wont let them.  There's only two songs on my mind tonight, Masque for one, its the only song i whistle at least once a day, and Roxeanne, the Moulin Rouge version, because ""its so powerful.""  Write something down whenever you get the chance, itll brighten your day. By the way, now you can leave comments on any of my posts, it would make my day if you left some, and remember, i can delete the ones that are stupid. So if you're stupid, dont bother leaving a comment. ~Clint",9
This is Unforgettable.,10
"In Bush We Trust?    John Moyers is Editor-in-Chief of TomPaine.com.   George W. Bush is a liar. There, I said it -- the ""L"" word. Someone in Washington had to.   Thanks to AWOL WMD, people all across America have the ""L"" word on their lips, but here in D.C. it's still a hard one to mouth. Few Washington-based commentators and fewer politicians have done so.   On Sunday, June 22, The New York Times had a chance to be the first big-league outfit to say it plainly. But the headline on Washington-based reporter David E. Rosenbaum's story, ""Bush May Have Exaggerated, but Did He Lie?"" was a tip that the story would pull up short. Rosenbaum considered a narrow question -- whether Mr. Bush has told any neat, tidy, obvious lies -- and concluded he has not (a couple of fibs and distortions, maybe, but no lies).   Whether the president twisted intelligence on WMD ""can probably be answered conclusively only by historians when all the evidence and consequences are known,"" Rosenbaum wrote. (So, our kids get to pay the debt for our imperial aspirations and our tax breaks, and someday they'll be the first to know how it all happened. Great.)   Distance seems to make criticism easier. The Times' Princeton-based columnist Paul Krugman has written that the administration ""systematically and brazenly distorts the facts"" and is ""choosing and exaggerating intelligence"" and ""misleading the public.""   Close, but still no ""L"" word.   Boston-based William Rivers Pitt isn't daunted: The administration ""lied us into a war,"" writes the high-school teacher who moonlights as a columnist for Truthout.org. ""Trust a teacher on this. We can spot liars who have not done their homework a mile away.""   A full-page ad in The New York Times last week by MoveOn.org and Win Without War, groups with members across the nation, put it plainly and hoisted the president on his own pointed WMD -- words of mass distortion. Under the headline ""MISLEADER"" the ad stacked up five of Mr. Bush's pre-war whoppers and noted, ""It would be a tragedy if young men and women were sent to die for a lie."" (Full disclosure: TomPaine.com liked the ad so much, we paid to run it in the June 30 issue of The Weekly Standard.)   Harley Sorensen, writing on SFGate.com, gets the prize for directness: ""Why mince words? These are the facts: 1) President George W. Bush is a liar. 2) Secretary of State Colin Powell is a liar. 3) Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld is a liar. 4) National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice is a liar."" No mincing there.   So the word is out there in different forms -- lie, lies, lying, liar. When will Mr. Bush's putative opponents in government, the Democrats, decide it's time to tell it like it is?   Democrats have accused the president of ""a pattern of deception and deceit"" (Sen. Bob Graham), said he's not been ""entirely truthful"" (Howard Dean), and led us to war based on ""unfounded assertions"" (Rep. Dennis Kucinich). Strong stuff, but no ""L"" word.   Opposition worthy of the name would push the GOP-controlled House and Senate hearings beyond the question of what the intelligence community knew about WMD, where it seems stalled.   Sen. Jay Rockefeller, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, could invoke committee rules that would allow his minority party to launch a full investigation. But he won't -- reportedly for fear of being seen as partisan.   If this isn't the time for partisanship -- after all, we're talking about manipulations that led the nation into war -- when is? Rockefeller's timidity is allowing committee Republicans to cover what looks more every day like a lie of literally global magnitude.   Perhaps Dems fear the day when WMD are found (and they will be found, by hook or by crook). But they needn't worry -- even if misleading the nation to war weren't an issue, Mr. Bush's record is full of lies.   The president says he supports our troops -- but he proposed cutting veterans' benefits and sidestepped a law meant to protect the health of soldiers headed for combat. His ""leave no child behind"" pledge is a fraud -- he's vastly underfunded his own education plan, and he signed the recent tax bill even after his GOP minions sneakily removed provisions benefiting low-income families. Mr. Bush says he's a ""compassionate conservative,"" but only a hard-hearted radical would push his Robin-Hood-in-reverse tax policies. He says he wants to expand national service programs, but he's presiding over a huge cut in AmeriCorps programs. Candidate Bush promised to be ""a uniter, not a divider,"" but his foreign policies have profoundly divided the international community, isolated America and devalued her stock in the eyes of world.   Mr. Bush's administration is built on lies, which means the granddaddy of them all is his promise to restore ""honor and integrity"" to the Oval Office.   Presidential Brain Karl Rove must be worried. Rove knows that any president's popularity rests more on whether voters think he's a believable and admirable leader than on the substance of issues. George W. Bush has that going for him -- people might not like his policies (if they understand them at all), but they like his swagger and certitude, and they trust him to do what he says.   But that trust could crumble if questions linger about whether the White House deceived us into war. Few of the president's allies could or would defend that -- even GOP-TV (a.k.a. Fox News) would have trouble explaining away that one.",10
"Opening up with these excellent quotes from our dear friend, Ann Coulter:  [more in-depth attacks on Coulter later today, I promise]  This is all from her new book, Treason. By the way, I'm firmly convinced that it should be considered treason to write this kind of filth.  ""Ashcroft has been incessantly attacked on the op-ed page of the New York Times by the same columnists who are now angrily demanding to know why the Bush administration didn't imprison all Arabs before Sept. 11. He has been compared to the Taliban. (And you're not a patriot in this war until a liberal has compared you to the Taliban.)""  ""Like everything liberals oppose but don't have a good argument for, all reasonable national security measures are called ""unconstitutional."" Whenever liberals are losing on substance, they pretend to be upset about process.""  ""While undermining victory in the Cold War, liberals dedicated themselves to mainstreaming Communist ideals at home... Betraying the manifest national defense objectives of the country is only part of the left's treasonous scheme. They aim to destroy America from the inside with their relentless attacks on morality and the truth. (p. 289)""  Oh, yeah. Let's destroy America! Hey, people! Where are your liberal grenades? WHAT?! You lent them to HALLIBURTON?!!  ""Whether they are defending the Soviet Union or bleating for Saddam Hussein, liberals are always against America. They are either traitors or idiots, and on the matter of America's self-preservation, the difference is irrelevant. Fifty years of treason hasn't slowed them down. (p. 16)""  Fifty years of Treason? If treason includes making sure that a bunch of fat pot bellied men don't take over the world, then bring treason on! *snorts* MANIFEST NATIONAL DEFENSE OBJECTIVES, indeed.  ""McCarthy's fundamental thesis was absolutely correct: The Democratic Party had fallen to the allures of totalitarianism. It was as if the Republicans had been caught in bed with Hitler. (p. 71)""  Now we get to my favorite part here; this is where Ann Coulter idolizes McCarthy. This is the same bastard who ruined thousands of lives and kind of ruined the country, but he wasn't a liberal! He must be great! Bitch! How DARE she?!  ""When the Democrats' bluff was called in a roll call vote in Congress, many voted for war with Iraq. Inadvertently performing a great service, New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd revealed the Democrats' treasonous calculations. She explained that Democrats would be forced to fake enthusiasm for the war on terror or lose the American people forever. Democrats, she said, ""fear that if they approach"" Iraq the same way they did during the Gulf War in 1991, ""they will be portrayed as McGovernite wimps."" Consequently, liberals would lie and pretend to support America. With their votes duly recorded, they went right back to attacking the war. (p. 14-15)""  While Maureen Dowd is not the nicest person in the world, I have yet to see her condemn every conservative in the world as having committed treason. Dowd might be petty, but there is a line where she stops and rarely crosses. Coulter on the other hand, has no problem discrediting actual achievements of people based solely on the fact that she does not LIKE them, as can be seen here:  ""Carter would travel to Norway to accept the award in December 2002 - two months after Congress had authorized war against Iraq. Article III's definition of treason is narrow. But after Congress's action authorizing war, for any American to accept this award on the ground offered does sound terribly like ""adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort."" (p. 257)""  Yes. Carter has actually helped people and done more than you ever have to help anyone else. Carter has saved lives, and Coulter has caused grief. Let's see. Who's the better person? I'm thinking here -  Oh, Clod. She is, indeed, a horrible person.",10
"Ok ... so here it goes. Icenhower was talking to me ... and she goes, shaking her head, ""Sreya ... I just got the grades ... they're terrible! What are you doing with yourself!

""  But on a funnier note, Colella and Connolly were talking and Colella goes, ""Ever since she got in to college she's been ... phew! Forgetting homeworks left and right!""  ""Well,"" Connolly goes, ""She must have been really smart. The way she acted in my class, she got accepted as a freshman!""",10
"I am afraid of failing Biology. I am also equally afraid of failing Calculus. Whatever I get in either of those classes should not matter because I'm going to retake them either in college, or in the case of the hated Calculus, I will be taking it over the summer.

"I am stuck on the plot for Sanguine Fortress. Every problem I solve creates a new one. Did you know that this hunk of junk is the largest project I have ever attempted? I won't say more than that ... I'd jinx myself.  What was today? (Two Ap exams in a row, pizza, gerbils and a very wise saying.) Samantha Figueroa asked me what I wanted to do in Spanish class yesterday, and I told her I want to make it possible for more Americans to have health insurance.  So she said to me, ""I don't know what you feel about what's up there ... but you know, you'd get mad points with him."" And that got me thinking more than anything else ... is there a God? I honestly don't know what to think anymore. I'm so FRIED.  Anyway ... everytime I write SF I feel better, although it's thoroughly depressing at the same time. So I'm going to keep going. And hopefully, sometime, I can read my work and say, ""Well ... I've gotten a damn sight better since then.""",10
"*Be Nice*  There was a little girl, Who didn't know what to do first. The razors caused too much pain, But life was much much worse. The strength to push down harder, Just wasn't really there. She wasn't very sure, But honestly didn't care. She thought no-one would miss her, Notice they would not. But little to her knowledge, She would never be forgot. People were all amazed, All her family could do is cry. Everyone felt bad, Her friends just wondered why. Teachers were confused, Her bullies all felt bad. If they were only nicer, Now they really wish they had    **The Girl** She’s the girl every one wanted She’s the girl that I could never have She’s the one that made my heart beat faster But why?   Was  she the girl for me….  When I starred into her eyes My whole world seemed to disappear….  When I held her hand Everything seemed so clear  When she smiled at me 	 It was nothing but bliss…  Do you remember …  Remember that day  It was just you and me Everything turned out great Just as expected to be  It was so unclear  Those moments we had.. I don’t know why…  But now I can see…  I don’t know why  I thought  you were so great I don’t know why I thought you could ever want someone like me I don’t know why I thought  We could ever be together Its something that’s so unclear to me  We are so alike in many ways Yet we seem to grow apart every single day I don’t know what I could do or say… To make you trust me To make you believe that Im only wishing for the best  I look back at one night..  And I don’t know why  it had to end like this.. The pain I felt inside was something indescribable  But for some reason I didn’t care Because I was with you  I only wish you could trust me.. And Id like you to know that I would never do you wrong I would never lie or do you harm…  But I don’t know… I don’t know if you’re the girl for me? Because right now Everything is unclear to me",11

DA ADBENTYURS OF HERMES AND JACKIE  ADBENTYUR #1 Uunahin ko yung mas matanda...si JACKIE Ipinanganak sha noong March 14, 1997. Nung dumating sha sa bahay namin...napaka-amo at mahiyain nya. Palaging nakabuntot sa akin...di ko sha mashado napaglalakad sa bahay nuong una dahil...meron na rin kaming isa pang dalmatian sa bahay...si SLY! Si Sly ay hindi purong dalmatian...80% lang sha...isa sa mga characteristics ng dalamatian ay ang pagiging territorial nito. Kaya nung dumating si Jackie sa bahay...nagkaroon agad ng mortal na kaaway. Habang lumalaki si Jackie...unti-unti naman itong nagkakasungay (hehehe). Siya ang nagle-lead sa iba pa naming aso (may 2 pa nun...si Sly(dalmatian) at Hubbs(terrier))para magkalat at mag-ingay sa bahay. May isang pagkakataon na binagsak ni Jackie yung salamin ng dining table namin.BASAG ANG SALAMIN!!! Hirap na hirap akong tanggalin sha dun...mabuti na lang at konting galos lang ang nakuha nya. Siguro kung kaya nya lang ibagsak ang piano matagal na nyang ginawa. Sa bahay...si Jackie at Sly ang umuubos ng betadine kesa sa aming pamilya. Lagi silang masaya sa garden...binabasag ang mga paso, nagbubungkal ng lupa...atbp. Maraming kuwento ng kakulitan itong si Jackie...tsaka ko na ibabahagi sa inyo! :D  Si Jackie ay isa sa mga pinaka-mabait naming aso...mabait na makulit. At eto ang isa pang natatangi nyang kakayahan...galit sha sa panget...no offense ha...pero minsan kumatok sa aming pintuan ayung isa naming kapitbahay na madaming inaaway...biglang tumahol si Jackie nang pagkalakas-lakas...at mistulang lalapain na iyong ale. Iyong aling iyon na maraming kaaway...at talagang masama ang ugali lang ang kinahulan ni Jackie ng ganung katindi.  Si Jackie rin ang aso naming marunong umarte...heto ang kanyang picture     sinasadya nyang pagandahin ang tenga nya ng mga panahong kinuhaan ko sha...kasi tangan ko sa kaliwa kong kamay ay isang biscuit. Itong aso kong ito...lahat kinakain...kahit papel kakainin nya...ganon kalaki ang tiwala nya sa akin.  itutuloy...    NOTE: THIS WAS ELOISE'S ORIGINAL POST",12
"I just want to remember this day.Earlier my aunt living in Nevada gave me a call. I barely recognized her voice because of her hard sobbing, and I instantly knew what was wrong.You see yesterday evening when she called me up, she's told me that right at that moment, her baby - Raider, a 7 year old black labrador - will go under the knife and that she and her husband were frantic, worried sick. She's told me that there were bumps over Raider's body. I knew it didn't looked good and my aunt who is a nurse, seemed to refuse to face the possibility that her baby could die...but 'mothers' are like that, aren't they? But when the vet cut Raider open, instantly they knew that the cancer has spread all over his body and there's just no hope. So immediately they told my aunt and uncle and asked them if they would want them to close him up, wake him up so that they can say goodbye. They were also told that Raider was really suffering. They chose to let him rest in peace. He was cremated and today his remain will be delivered to my aunt.  I just want to remember this day when I wasn't able to console my aunt.....The day when I realized, that someday, I will experience the same thing when my babies decide to 'go away', for good.Raider, rest in peace....someday mom and dad will be just fine.",12

"i first met him  a little more than three years ago, when i was volunteering at the local dog shelter. we found him abandoned at his original owner's home. the owner left him, though she really didn't want to -- she had to go to heaven. so there he was: barely three months old, very frightened, and very alone. he didn't know we were there to help him, and so he was a difficult little ball of fur to handle.   i came into the room and our eyes met, neither of us realizing that at that moment, both our lives were going to change forever . as the days passed, he eventually warmed up to me -- he possessed all of the usual shar pei attributes, including being aloof and even suspicious of strangers. i named him noah, because of his burly disposition and the wrinkles on his face, he reminded me of an old man. he won my heart completely and i decided to be the one to give him his new permanent home. he decided to give my life some meaning.  i live alone, noah gives me reason to look forward to coming home every day. he is an intelligent dog, and typical to most shar peis,  he acts with great dignity  and is completely loyal to me. he trusts me implicitly. he makes me feel needed, like i'm a fine person and that i'm safe. definitely, safe, for he is very territorial and though he has never bitten anyone, he lets guests know he doesn't like their presence in his turf. shar peis are definitely not for the first-time dog owners, but i've had lots of experience with dogs in the shelter. i was very lucky that i had the chance to get to know such a magnificent creature. without noah, i'd have been lost long ago.  sadly, noah's plight is not at all uncommon.  there are millions of dogs in shelters , waiting for someone to take them home and give them all the love and affection that they're more than willing to return. in england alone, every citizen must have 14 dogs each to give all the dogs there a home. if you're thinking of having a dog, please visit the shelter in your area. or at the very least, research about the breed you are thinking of buying, so that you will know what to expect. having a dog is an enormous, long term responsibility, one that we should all think of very thouroughly before acting on. the rewards, however, would be beyond your wildest dreams.",12
"I have always loved animals; especially DOGS. Growing up, I had all sorts of pets; from Birds, Rabbits, Fishes to Dogs. Each were special in their own way. What I appreciated most from these animals is their ability to sense our feelings. They know when you're down, when you're happy...they know YOU.  Five years ago, when my brother went back to the Philippines to continue his education; we got a Dog...just to keep him company. A Dog named Boo. She was a sweet little thing, a sweet and beautiful Mongrel. As time went by, we all got attached to the Dog. Although the rest of my family and I were living overseas, each and everytime we'd go back, she was always there. She was a part of our family. As she grew, her primitive instincts developed and she became one of the most feared dogs in our neighbourhood. She protected our home. She protected us.  Apart from being the protector that she was; she was also a very good mother to her puppies. It was such a sweet sight whenever we'd give her little goodies then she'd call her babies one by one; feeding the youngest first. She had always put her kids first. Just like we humans do. She also offered us lil gifts at times. She once caught a fish and brought it to my dad. She also caught a bird and did the same thing. Everybody loved her.  Two Years Ago, we received a Phone Call from my Cousin. He lived with my brother and he too looked after Boo. He told us that the 15 year old son of our neighbour had shot our Boo in the heart - IN OUR FRONTYARD.  She was 3 months pregnant...and she was shot right in the heart...right in the heart. She laid there, in our resthouse and bled to death. My Cousin phoned by brother shortly after and he rushed home.  My whole family was outraged. Everyone cried. We loved that dog so much. People say that we are foolish to have such a strong attachment to just an ANIMAL. She wasn't just an ANIMAL to us; she was our FAMILY. Til this day, I still find it hard to talk about the incident. Writing this has made tears well up in my eyes. It still hurts. I still miss my Dog. Sometimes its hard to understand the things people do. Animals are still living beings...they breathe, they feel, they love just as we do.  My family has tried to take the case to court. However, since it is the Philippines, nothing much has been accomplished because according to them, it was just an ANIMAL. Since the incident occured, I havent returned to the Philippines. I do not know if I could control myself under the circumstances of seeing that family and remembering what they did to my Dog. It still hurts and I still miss her.",12
"A new added attraction on our mini zoo... :D she's a 3 monts old monkey and we call her Chi-chi.  At first medyo takot pa sya sa tao. Medyo aloof.. and mabaho. hehehe!! Ano nga ba naman ang maaasahan mo sa pet shop to take care of this little soul.. siguro matagal na siyang walang ligo. Medyo manipis ang hair nya and payat talaga. Kawawa namang nilalang. Nabulunan pa nga nung first time naming pinakain ng saging... and we thought fruits lang ang puede nyang kainin.  As week pass, medyo nakakarelate na din siya sa environment nya. Nililiguan namin siya thrice a week and she slept with my sister. Of course, medyo takot kami kasi baka may sakit, may ebola, may aids, lahat-lahat na but then unresistable talaga ang charm ng little chi-chi na to sa amin.  Oh my.. kumakain din pala ng kanin ang unggoy. Minsan kasabay namin siyang kumain.. OO nga.. nang-aagaw sila ng pagkain minsan. hehehe! may pagkamaldita lang tong bata na to kasi pag nandyan na nanay nya (my sister).. ayaw ng sumama sa kin. Whenever her mom's at school, she's here with me at my shop... and she always fall asleep in my arms na parang baby talaga. As we know, maingay dito sa shop.. pag inaantok na ang bata at may biglang malakas na tunog.. sumisigaw siya... minsan bumubulong.. siguro sa loob-loob nya  ""ano ba naman tong lugar na to.. ang dilim dilim pero ang ingay""  or kaya  ""ano ba kayo! inaantok ako! wag kayong maingay!""  hahaha!!    Ah.. may isang beses lang pala siyang sumama sa kin na nasa tabi lang nya yung sister ko.. wala pang isang minute.. inihian ako. Bad Chi-chi! Even Bullit have an experience on her peeing habit... Ganon siguro sila, parang sinasabi na.. ""this is my property"" chuvabelles. :)  Her latest improvement.. Playful. At first, takot siya sa 3 aso namin... even with my little Schat. Minsan kasi tinatahulan or kinakagat siya (kagat na lambing) nung mga babies ko but not now.. palaban na din ang matsing. Not really palaban pero kaya na nyang makipagsabayan. One morning, nasa lapag lang siya at di nilalapitan ng mga aso.. Di siya pinapansin. Nilapitan si Achilles (which is so big na..) at kinurot near his pwet. Syempre, ang initial reaction ng aso.. kinahulan tapos kinakagat-kagat siya.. She also do that.. nakikagat din ang loka.. Nakita ni Schat na nilalaro ni Achilles si Chi-chi.. lumapit ang dalaga ko (si schat).. ang nakiharot na din. Contented ang 2 (Schat and achilles) kasi nakaganti and they left her. Ay naku.. she didn't even cry kahit pinagtulungan nung dalawa. Pero Chi-chi is not contented, nilapitan ang Schat at siya naman ang kinurot. Tawa na lang kami ng tawa sa kalokohan nya. hehehe! Don lang sa isang aso (na adult na talaga) siya di makaporma kasi baka iwasiwas siya non. Hahaha!  Ok na yung itsura nya ngayon... Makapal na yung balahibo nya, may buhok na unlike before na nakakalbo siya.. and syempre.. tumaba na din. :)  Sabi ko sa sister ko, ituring nya yan parang tao.. dapat laging yakapin, alagaan (as what Ate Thess told me) pero parang sobra ata tong kapatid ko kasi kahit pagtulog at pagkain.. magkasama na sila. Hehehe!    I really wanted to post a picture of my sister and chi... pero di maupload dito eh.. can somebody help me.         posted by: JOANNE",12
"I thought of posting this photo of Danielle when one day I saw her, just her head, peeking outside when she heard the noises I was making in the kitchen. Curious as she's always been and with half eyes closed, there she was trying to find out what mama's been up to.        taken yesterday ( july 31st )...this was Gizmo sleeping on top of his shirt. It's a known fact that ferrets sleep in the dark but since we've been having warm weather the past days, the light didn't seemed to bother him ( Jacob and Danielle were sleeping under their other shirt )        Also taken yesterday, their dad and I decided to buy them a piano hoping to find out if we have a  Mozart  in the family ( that's not all together true, we got jealous because the other day, we saw a piano-playing-ferret on tv so we thought.. perhaps our kids can do better. )  Jacob  played about  3 notes  out of curiosity. Papa and mama actually clapped their hands when they heard what  Jacob  has accomplished!          Unfortunately the piano didn't interest them at all, all they wanted to do was to destroy it.  KIDS do the darnest thing!!",12
Lord thank You and take away all fears that I have right now.  Give me and fill me up with Your love.  Right now I am scared and need your help desperately.  Please work everything out for Your good.  Help me love You and act on that love by loving other people and worshipping You.,13
"Father,  Make the deepest desire of my heart be for me to live to glorify You and have You glorified in me.  There is nothing else that can fit Your will completely in me.  Help and give me a mindset with this in mind.  I want to die to my flesh, so that I may be able to walk in Your Spirit and likeness.  I want to reject any part of myself and gain all of Your qualities.  I need You to save me from myself, or before I know it, I will kill myself, but not to You but to the world.  Save me from everything, give me Your strength.    Love, Hannah",13
"Lately I have been so confused of what I have been feeling.  I know that what I am doing is right, that I have God's blessing, that I am in His will.  Yet, at times I feel like I am having pride and lack of love and compassion.  I wonder, will I have the words to express all these things?  Will I make sense?  Why did I take this burden on myself?  Why didn't I allow God to help me?  Why didn't I go to Him and let Him open my eyes sooner?  Why was everyone so scared to tell me?  Why didn't I listen when they actually did?  Man, I can be a dumb man.  Yet, thank you Lord that You are bigger than me and all of this.  Thank YOU Jesus, that You are helping me through this.  Guide me Lord and show me when and how to communicate and love her through this.",13
"All my life I have been trying to please my dad.  God has continually told me, ""Please Me and you will be pleasing your dad.""  So then I continue to try to press on to be obedient to the Lord and follow Jesus daily.  As I grow and notice the truths in His word and the wickedness of the world around me, I get more and more convictions that I need to follow in my life and obey.  Yet, then I become a person that my dad doesn't want me to be.  He wants me to do nothing but get a degree and get married.  He doesn't want to wait for the right timing.  He doesn't want me to serve God.   He misunderstands so many points in the scriptures and then gets angry with me because I try to follow them out.  He is the only person that doesn't want me to go to Africa because I need to go to school.  He is upset with the way I am turning out.  Yet, since his expectations of Sarah are lower, I would say that he is equally pleased with both of us.  I'm not saying I am perfect or he should even be proud of me.  He has asked, ""Can't there be something in the middle?""  Why does he want idle daughters that want only what the world around us tells us to?  Why doesn't he want me to serve the Lord by working with children in Africa?  The Lord has been so faithful to me and yet he doesn't even notice.  Yet, I can't have the hope of pleasing my dad, I just need to be obedient to God.   Many times my relationship with my father is the hardest struggle in my life.  I want to obey him and respect him as I am told to do in Galatians and Colossians and throughout the Bible, yet he doesn't even respect the fact that I am attempting to follow Jesus daily and to go where He is leading me.  My dad may never be supportive or see the views that I hold, but I know that they are of the Lord and Jesus is there helping me and guiding me.  Once again, Jesus tells me, ""I love you, you are in My will.  Don't wonder what he wants, only do what I want.  Never feel bad for doing what I desire.""",13
"Wahoo!  So much is going on.  I am praying about going to Africa and an application to Rainbows of Hope is being mailed to me today.  I am pretty sure this is the organization that I want to go with.  I hope Jessica likes it too.  It really seems like God wants me to go.  I pretty much just need to trust in Him to provide and show me the way.  God is good, all the time.  All the time, God is good.",13
"In the pamphlet, ""My Heart - Christ's Home"", Robert Boyd Munger is talking about how he was spending time in the morning's with Jesus in the living room.  He had been missing the daily time and hurrying in the mornings.  One morning he saw Jesus in there waiting and he asked Jesus if He had been there all along.  Then Jesus explaned:  ""The trouble is that you have been thinking of the quiet time, of Bible study and prayer, as a means for your own spiritual growth.  This is true, but you have forgotten that this time means something to me also.  Remember, I love you.  At a great cost I have redeemed you.  I value your fellowship.  Just to have you look up into my face warms my heart.  Don't neglect this hour if only for my sake.  Whether or not you want to be with me, remember I want to be with you.  I really love you!""   I know this is how the Lord feels and that I really need to spend more time with Him.  Yet, He has been on the back burner.  I need to move Him up to the front and make Him my top priority.  I have in some ways, like with my convictions.  Yet I haven't with my time.  I continually put people as more important in my schedule.  I know that there are technically 2 front burners on the stove, but God needs to be on both.  Lord help me make you more important in my life.  Help me stand up for You and the things You desire for me to do.  They are important and I need to make the things important to You important to me.  Thank You for your faithfulness to me.",13
"There are so many questions that I wonder about the Bible.  How do I know how to wait while I am trying to figure them out.  I have been trying to figure out some things like:  1) Is the first part of 1 Cor. 11 cultural or literal  2) Is it okay to speak in tongues to oneself in a church service  3) How far must we go to prevent stumbling others  . . . Plus many more.  For example, 1 Cor. 14:34 says, ""Let your women keep silent in the churches, for they are not permitted to speak; but they are to be submissive, as the law also says."" 1 Tim. 2:11 says, ""Let a woman learn in silence with all submission."" According to the strongs, silent means silence and churches means a meeting place (jewish synagogue, church) that includes saints of the earth and in HEAVEN.  Yet, this word for woman means wife.  Where do the single women lie in this?  What are we called to do?  Is it possible for when the Bible says the word, ""brother"" ""man"" it is really referring to the male gender only?  I ask all of this not to bring more confusion, but to maybe figure it out.  I know that I am called to pray and study out this issues.  However, what do I do while I wait.  Do I be silent or do I continue to speak?  Is it my pride that makes me want to speak?  Or if I stopped to speak, could I end being like the servant that buried his gift in the sand?  I see both sides as not good options.   I just want to serve the Lord and to try to understand what HE wants me to do.  I know that I can't always be able to look, read, and follow.  Yet, I definitely need some more insight on this one.    Tongues? . . . 1 Cor. 14:18-19 ""I thank my God I speak with tongues more than you all; yet in the church I would rather speak five words with my understanding, that I may teach others also, than then thousand words in a tongue. 1 Cor. 14:16 (Amplified)  ""Otherwise, if you bless and render thanks with [your] spirit [thoroughly aroused by the Holy Spirit], how can anyone in the position of an outsider or he who is not gifted with [interpreting of unknown] tongues, say the Amen to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you are saying?"" I guess my questions are: Can we not speak in tongues around other people?  Even if it's under our breath?  Can we not speak in tongues when other people are praying (in the known language).  This is what I am seeing in the verses, yet I am not seeing it practiced - even by myself.  Stumbling others. . . How are we supposed to prevent others from stumbling when we don't know what stumbles them?  How do we know if they are healed?  How can we be cautious?  As a group, can we prevent doing certain activities for the benefit of others?  Can we be sensitive to everyone's needs and struggles?  How far should we go for these things?  Just random thoughts. . .",13
"Last night I went to Quo Vadis.  We all shared what God has been doing in our lives, and I was able to share how God has been helping me with my fears.  Then, of coarse, comes an opportunity to face one of them.  As we were all talking about playing the jimbay, they asked if I wanted to give it a try.  I said, ""No, I don't have rhythm"".  It's okay, you just feel it.  ""No, seriously, I can't hear it or feel it.  I do not want to play it.""  Just when they stopped asking. . .   God says, ""Is this another fear?"" Me, ""Yes, it's pride, huh?"" God, ""Yes"" Me, ""Alright, so even if it is Lord, I am not going to overcome it today.""  I began thinking of ways I could maybe practice it at home to try it at a later date. Me, ""No, I am definitely not going to do it today.  I will look and sound stupid.  I can't keep a rhythm."" God, ""So, I am helping you over come your fears?  You just told them all about it earlier. How about you actually do what you were talking about.  Overcome it."" Me, ""I can't get out of it.  Fine one song, that's it.""  So, I did.  God finally won.  It was actually fun.  Who would've guessed it.  Micah seems to think I kept the rhythm throughout the song.  I know I messed up a little bit.  But it was actually fun and I did it!  Praise the LORD!  After all, it's all for him anyways.  He doesn't care what it sounds like.  Thinking back, I actually said to God,  ""Lord, I am not going to overcome it today.""     How can I possibly call Him Lord and not be submissive to His voice.  Isn't the meaning of Lord that I am supposed to submit and serve Him?  Hmmm, as I'm talking to Him, I use an oxymoron.  If I am not submitting to Him, then why call Him Lord?  Hello, that is so dumb of me.  Like calling Him Lord makes my desire of disobedience better or not as bad.  Yet, Jesus is consistent and really desires me to obey, so He did everything He could to help me be obedient.  HE is good and great.  Praise the LORD!, for real this time.",13
"Never Underestimate My JESUS You tell me there's no hope I'm telling you you're wrong! Never Underestimate My JESUS When the world around you crumbles You will be strong, You will be strong    Can I be free of this unreleasable sin Overcoming the obstacles are Overcoming my fears    Never underestimate my Jesus  Isn't that the truth?  Lord even though,  ""I think I can't, I think I can't,  but I think YOU Can, I think YOU Can!   Gather my Insufficiencies,  place them in Your hands, place them in Your hands."" Lord, help me keep them there.  Help me Lord. Thank You for the continuing reminder that You are working on resolving my fears.  Praise You LORD!",13

"Tonight at home group, the Lord was really teaching me and reminding me of different things.  They seem so milky and at an elementary level of biblical knowledge.  But this is where I am at.  Tonight we studied 1 John 3.  Micah brought up how amazing the first phrase is ""  See how great a love the Father has bestowed on us  , that we would be called children of God. . . ""  I was thinking, 'yeah, so.  He loves us, but why is that so amazing, we already know this.'  Then God started to show me why it is so amazing.  As I have been dealing with all of these fears, God was telling me, ""I love You.  You are My child.  I will protect You like any good earthly father.  I have your best in mind.  I know the best thing for You.""  All of a sudden, wow, why do I doubt You Lord.  Why do I doubt who You are and Your love for me?  Lord give me more trust in You.    We also talked a lot about loving other people.  For the past couple of days I have been asking people, do I tell people the truth about the Bible and God's ways when they view me as holy rollers, Molly Mormon, and think I am putting myself on a higher level than them?  So many times when I tell my family something that is concrete in God's word like 1 Jn. 3:6-8, it's black and white and there is nothing anyone can do to change the meaning of it.  Yet, then Grant brought up 1 Jn. 3:18 ""Little children, let us not love with word or with tongue, but in deed and truth.""  Telling my family the truth about these things is loving them  in truth .  Even if they don't percieve it as love, it is still love.  Just as David reminded me, I need to pray for them.  I need to pray a whole lot.  Lord help me not give up on my family.  Help me realize You have Your hand on my family's lives and You love them so much more than I do. Micah brought up too that we need to be more open and honest with people.  Answer people's questions truthfully about our lives and not try to make people comfortable.  Chrissy added that if we are more bold with people and they decide to no longer have fellowship with us, then that can be a good thing.  It can show them what exactly is missing in their life.  They might miss it when it's gone.  Today I read about the flood.  It continually shows how Noah obeyed all that God commanded him.  It says how Noah was a righteous man.  Yet, the first thing he did when he got off the ark was get drunk and naked.  The Lord dealt with him accordingly and Noah dealt when Shem accordingly when he looked upon Noah's nakedness.  These chapters really show God's mercy and love in having a remnant of people that was saved.  They also show how the Lord has a balance of His mercy and grace with the need of being obedient to Him.  Lord help me be obedient and remember the promises You have given to me.  Help me rely more upon You.  I love You Lord.",13
"Come to find out I have more and more fears approaching daily.  In the past couple of days, I have realized just how many fears I have.  I have the fear of the Lord picking someone for me that I won't like.  I have fear of the unknown.  I have fears of looking stupid (like when I am dancing), which is PRIDE.  I have a fear of not being a good enough witness.  I also have a fear of the demonic realm.  I have a fear that I can't get past all of my fears.   Yesterday I read Proverbs 1.   vs. 33 says, ""But whoever listens to me will dwell safely, And will be secure,  without fear of evil ."" Luke 12:32 says, ""Do not fear, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom."" 1 Tim. 1:7 says, ""For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind."" Psalm 112:7 says, "" He will not be afraid of evil tidings ; His heart is steadfast, trusting in the Lord."" Isaiah 35:4 says, ""Say to those who are fearful-hearted 'Be strong, do not fear!  Behold, your God will come with vengeance, with recompense of God;   He will come and save you  .""  Lord, You give me some awesome promises and resources to rely upon.  Why don't I trust You?  Why do I doubt that You will come and save me?  Why do I doubt that I have been given more power from You than in the demonic realm?  Why do I doubt that greater is You in me than is of the world?  Lord, I admit to you all of my fears, worries, and struggles.  I know I have a lack of faith and trust in You.  You have shown Yourself to be more faithful to me over all situations.  Help me trust You more.  Help me remember all the times You have saved me from myself, danger, and my sins.  Help me remember all the times You have prevented me from making wrong turns in my life.  I praise You for how You have been faithful to me through all of my struggles, and through all of the victories You have helped me achieve.  Lord, continue to be my helper.  Help me go to You for help Jesus.  I love You, and I want to love You even more.  Amen.",13
"A while ago, I was reading Exodus 14 and verses 13 and 14 say, ""Do not be afraid.  Stand form and you will see the deliverance the Lord will bring you today.  The Egyptians you see today you will never see again.  The LORD will fight for you; you need only to be still.""  The Lord fights constantly for all of our battles, especially the spiritual ones within.  He is good and all we need to do is be still and know that He is Lord.    A couple of days ago I read Exodus 35:21, 36:6-7 "". . . Everyone who was willing and whose heart moved him came and brought an offering to the Lord fo rth ework on the Tent of Meeting, for all its service, and for the sacred garments.  All who were willing. .  . . Then Moses gave an order and they went this word throughout the camp:  'No man or woman is to make anything else as an offering for the sanctuary.'  And so the people were restrained from bringing more, because what they already had was  more than enough  to do all the work.""  Wouldn't it be nice if this was the problem today.  I think that we need to be wise to who we give to, yet I think it's impossible to give too much to the right source.  Everything I have is God's and I need to remember that.  It's not on loan.  The things that God does give me though, I should go to Him to show me how to use it wisely for His good purpose.",13
"1 Corinthians 5:11 ""But now I have written to you not to keep company with anyone named a brother, who is sexually immoral, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner - not even to eat with such a person.""   Sounds somewhat simple now, right?  Wrong.  Applying this verse to my life is very hard.  My sister fits these things and now I need to figure out how to be obedient to this.  How much time is it okay to spend with her?  Are my parents supposed to ostricize her out of the family?  I don't know.  My uncle mostly, and also my cousins, probably claim to many people that they are Christians, yet they are drunks.  Am I not to go to any family functions?  Am I supposed to be like my Grandad and just pretend like it's not going on?  This is what I am going to seek out.",13
"Just as I think, ""most of my questions are getting answered - or at least not as confusing"", I get some new questions.  I am beginning to realize,  ""THERE IS ALWAYS MORE TO LEARN ABOUT LIVING OUT CHRISTIANITY.  FROM THIS, THERE WILL ALWAYS BE MORE QUESTIONS.  IT'S NOT BAD TO BE QUESTIONING AND FIGURING OUT HOW TO LIVE OUT THE BIBLE.  THIS IS ATTEMPTING TO LIVE OUT LIFE AS A CHRISTIAN.""   I have been feeling like I have been legalistic lately, yet I haven't.  I am simply attempting to be obedient to the things the Lord has been convicting me about.  Have I perfected it, no way, I have a long way to go.  Yet, doing things because the bible says so isn't legalistic, it's being obedient to Jesus.       Galatians 3:1-3 says,  ""O foolish Galatians!  Who has bewitched you that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed among you as crucified?  This only I want to learn from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?  Are you so foolish?  Having begun in hte Spirit, are you now being made perfect by the flesh?""  So basically, I just need to be able to trust in God as I am doing things and not try to do it out of my flesh.  It's a lot easier to not be legalistic than I thought.  Just because others may think I am being legalistic as I am being obedient, doesn't mean it's true.  I can't make my walk decrease because of others misconceptions.  I am not saying this pridefully, I am saying it because it is more important to be obedient to God and please Him by obeying Him than by worrying about what others think about my walk.",13
"Sometimes I think ""What am I hearing?  Who am I listening to?  How am I supposed to respond to it?""  So then I wonder, what if I am putting these thoughts into my own head.  Maybe, just maybe I want to hear what I want so bad that I say it to myself.  Then I go into the mode, ""Maybe my whole way of wanting answers is so clogged up in my head that I couldn't hear God if He was even trying to speak to me.""  Then I go to, ""Well, God always talks, so Lord, open up and clear my mind that I may hear what You are saying not what I am trying to make myself hear what I want to hear.  I want to know what you desire.""  Just a few thoughts that go through my mind, a kind of spiritual warfare.  Jesus promises in John 10:3-4 ""To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.  And when he brings out his own sheep, he goes before them and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice.""  I know I am His sheep and HE is my shephard.  Even when satan tries to lead me astray or attempts to 'answer' the questions going through my head, I am not going to follow.  This is what this verse means, right?  Yet, Jesus will guide me and show me because I belong to Him and He is going to guide me in the ways in which I shall go.  I am supposed to always be able to discern what He is calling me to do.  Yet, what if I don't want to, then what?  I still belong to Him and my free will takes over.  Now I don't want this to happen, yet I know I choose the other way all the time.  If I didn't I would be sinless, and I am clearly not.  So is this just an honest attempt to show the every-day struggles in my life.  Maybe.  Does it mean it makes since.  Clearly not.  It only makes since to me.  I realize this, yet, I know that when I do discern and be obedient to God, then it makes it easier for me to hear Him the next time.  So, Lord, Help me be obedient to You and hear what You are telling me to do.  All this for, I finally have peace regarding the whole women issue.  I need not to worry about it any more.  The whole conflict in my head was killing me and just confusing me so much that it felt like my mind was leaving my body.  Yet, I have it once again.  Wahoo!  I hope and pray I have the right interpretation this time.  So, I am not to interupt service or teach man.  This is how I now look at this verse. (1 Cor. 14:34-35)  I now have peace and the comfort that the only Lord can fill.  He is good.  After years of trying to study and figure out the verses, I now know what He calls me to follow.",13

I was wondering if anyone saw a connection between the OT passages and the NT passage.  It almost looks like the 1 Cor. verse is the NT principle from the OT verses.  It's interesting to me that it requires someone to testify even when they learn about it, not just when someone sees it.  God's word is always good, it's not always easy to follow, yet when it is obeyed, the reward is great.",13
"Romans 11:32 ""For God has shut up all in disobedience so that He may show mercy to all.""  It's a shocking verse, but an awesome one.  He wants to show us mercy.  He wants to so badly give us what we don't deserve.  Romans 8:28  ""And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose."" 2 Timothy 2:13  ""If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself.""  These scriptures are awesome.  When we are disobedient, He, our awesome Lord and God, is still able to use it in our lives.  From this, we are able to begin to grasp part of His mercy, at least the mercy being shown to us at that particular time.  Praise the Lord that He is even able to use our sins to reveal His holy character to us in our lives!",13

He does not retain His anger forever,  Because He delights in unchanging love .""  When we think we understand it, it brings us back to the Israelites. If we think we can grasp it or put it to a certain measure (even a big one), we are still minimizing it. The Israelites used to make idols, like themselves, and worship them. There's this song, and it's a good one, and one of the lines is  hold me just like any father would . Yet, I think the song should say,  hold me better than any father would  In a way, it limits God to a human father's standard.  He's God, He can do more. I just don't want to think I understand His love, grace, or mercy. I don't want to minimize them in any way with my own comprehension. I know they are unending, uncircumstantial, and uncomprehensible. I know we have a sovereign God and shows us how He loves us daily.",13

Why is it that the people I expect the least from I see the greatest change?  Why is it the ones I doubt their love for God are the ones with fire burning within their hearts?  Why is it that even when I am  supposed to be in leadership  I still judge people by their appearance and even their character?  Why is it that these are the very ones that God uses within my own life to teach me a few things?  God says that none of us are above one another and not to think of oneself higher than he ought to think.  There were youths last week that showed me what I could have been like in high school if I ever had boldness - if I allowed God to work in my life and didn't try to hide Him everywhere I went.  Praise the Lord for the ones that are shockingly in love with the Lord and desiring to follow Him wholeheartedly.,13
"""Live in harmony with each other. Don't try to act important, but enjoy the company of ordinary people. And don't think you know it all!""  Romans 12:16 NLT    Can one verse have any more themes?  It was Air1's verse of the day, and since I listen to it ALL day long at work, I heard it many times.  It kept on speaking to me.  It's simple really. Be loving. Be humble. Be teachable.  Enjoy the company of ordinary people is kind of funny to me.  I think it means that people put certain people on pedastals - pastors, elders, leaders in the church.  Yet we don't need to spend all of our time with the godliest of the godly people.  We can simply love on and be friends with anybody.  It goes good with the verse, ""don't think of anyone higher than ye ought to think""  Maybe that verse is ""don't think of yourself more highly than ye ought to think"".  Regardless, I think it applies to both.  We need to be humble and can't think highly of ourselves.  Yet if we elevate others, we will be let down and may end out making them an idol in our lives.  We must be careful and pray for God's help and love to teach us and sustain us.",13
"""Things don't always work out the way you want them to,  but things always work out the way they are supposed to.""  My supervisor from my work said that yesterday.  She has been going through a tough time.  Even though I haven't been through anything bad lately, I think it is still applicable to any situation and anyone.  Ecclessiastes 3:1 says, ""To everything there is a time, to everything there is a season.""   So many times I will want to know something right away.  Where should I work?  What should I do?  Should I be going to school?  To become a teacher or occupational therapist?  When is the next stage of my life coming?  Yet, it will all come in the time that God has planned and that He allows.  I don't need to worry about anything, it will all happen when it's supposed to - when God wants it to.",13
"Tuesday night at home group we were worshipping and then we spent some time just listening to God.  God brought Josh Prior to mind - the guy that interviewed me for a position at Insight.  I didn't know why so I just started praying for him and his walk with God.  God told me that He wanted me to make a commitment to pray for him.  I told Him, ""Well, if I get the job that will be easy because I'll see him.  But if I don't get the job than you'll really have to remind me because I'll forget.""  God said again, ""I want you to commit to pray for him.""  ""Ok, but please help me remember.""  Next, God brought to mind the church directory.  I was trying to find his name in it.  As I was meditating on that, I realized God wants to use me to help draw Josh back to God.  I don't know what kind of walk he has, but I know God wants to increase it.  God wants to use me in some way in Josh's life - whether it's through prayer or through my life - i don't know.  Right now, I just have peace and know God knows.  This is all that matters.  Lord, bless Josh tonight and this weekend.  May You draw him closer to You and show him Your presence.  May he feel Your presence Lord, and may You give him a hunger and thirst for more and more of You.  Thank  You Lord for the work You are doing within him.  Praise You Lord for how You work in all of us in such different ways.  I love You Lord Jesus.",13
"I was talking to one of the girls in the youth group, and she was telling me about how she tries so hard to be nice to a girl but the girl just doesn't like in her return.  It made me start thinking.  John 13:34 says, ""A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another.""   We are called to love.  Not just our friends, but also our enemies.  In other words, we're not supposed to love people just so we can get loved back.  We are called to love to be obedient to Christ.  That is all we can do.  For those people that just might not like our personalities or that we may have hurt in the past - just love them.  Continue to show them the love of Christ.  That is enough.  There's nothing else we can do.  This is something that we can rest in.  It may or may not effect the relationship with that person.  Yet, we can rest in the fact that we are being obedient to our Lord - Adonai.",13
"Today I went and washed my car.  But, only the outside of it got clean.  I told myself that I would clean out the inside of it later.  But hey - it looks clean, right?  I immediately thought about how people might try to appear clean on the outside, to the people around them.  However, in order to be truly clean spiritually is to be clean on the inside.  Continually repenting and confessing to the Lord, letting the Word wash us clean by the power of the Spirit and of the blood.    We can't just appear clean, we need to be cleaned by God.",13
"Last night I had a dream that I was at ASU East.  I saw an old friend from junior high and we were talking in the parking lot with someone from church.  Then, all of a sudden, everyone in the parking lot began singing and signing  I Can Only Imagine  by Mercy Me.  It was an awesome picture on a secular campus.    Romans 15:9-11 ""and for the Gentiles to glorify God for His mercy; as it is written, 'Therefore I will give praise to You among the Gentiles, And I will sing to Your name.' And again he says, 'Rejoice, O Gentiles, with His people.' And again, 'Praise the Lord all you Gentiles, And let all the peoples praise Him.'""",13
"Influence.  It is a powerful thing. Paul was able to say ""Imitate me as I imitate Christ"". I see people with a huge amount of influence on the people around them. I see the people that look to them and are taking on the other person's behavior. It can be a very bad thing if they are imitating the wrong parts of someone's character. When we are in a position where people look to us as how Christians are supposed to act and look, we need to make sure that we are representing Christ as dear children.   It doesn't mean that we need to pretend we're perfect.  It simply means that when we make mistakes, we choose how to respond correctly and with integrity. May all of us youth leaders be the appropriate influence on the youth, that they may desire to draw closer to God and yearn to spend more time with Him.",13
"Last Wednesday at Youth Group, Allison and Jake did an awesome skit.  Allison went around and gave every person a candy bar, and Jake had to do 5 push-ups for them to get their candy.  After Jake had done quite a few push-ups, people stopped wanting their candy.  But, Jake still did push-ups for them even if they didn't want their free candy.  Every time someone was getting their piece of candy, Jake would look at them and say, ""Ok"".  It affected me so much because some of those kids that were there he doesn't even know their names.  Yet, he would look at them and then do his 5 push-ups for them.  His arms started hurting really bad, but he would just stretch and then do more.  In the end, Jake did 180 push-ups.  He continually did them faithfully until we made him stop.  Allison then said, sometimes actions mean more than words.  This is just a little glimpse of what the cross should mean to us and what Jesus went through.  We felt bad for Jake after about 30 push-ups.  Yet, Jesus wasn't even recognizable as a human when He was put onto the cross.  It was an awesome picture of what an average person can do to serve people, yet it can't even compare to the price that Jesus paid for us.  Thank you Lord for all that You went through.  I love you Jesus.",13
"""I am addicted to you""  I heard this line in a secular song.  It's awesome, if it's about God.  I want to be addicted to God, to the point that I would be:  *Sick without Him *Depend upon Him to make me happy and give me joy *He is the one that controls my life *Everything about my life is revolved around Him *All of my money is His and spent where He desires *I would not go long without spending time with Him  Jesus, You are the One thing I want to be addicted to.  You are the Lord of my life and I want don't want You to just be the center of my life.  I want You to be my life.  I want to be addicted to You.  I want you to be in my thoughts and heart continually.  I want my mind to be focused upon You and heavenly things.  I praise You and thank You for being my Father, my Saviour, and my Redeemer.",13
"The other night I got to babysit my little cousin, Dakota.  She clearly wasn't tired, but I had to put her to sleep - it was already 10:00.  At about 10:30, she was just lying in her crib and talking galore.  To who?  I have no idea.  Then I heard her say, ""Thank you for Hannah, Mommy, Daddy, Dakooota.""  Then she kept on saying all of our names again.  It was so sweet.  Perhaps she was praying.  I don't know, but this encouraged me that the Lord has His hand on her life.",13
"God created the moon and the stars to be the light in the world admist the darkness.  Saturday night I was in a church service and the Lord showed me how this is an example how God can use His creation to teach the church.  Just as Timothy and Silas helped Paul raise his hands (maybe this was Stephen), God has the body of a church lift up the arms of their pastor.  We can do this by praying for them, tithing, and supporting him in the decisions he makes.  The pastor can represent the moon and the church body represents all of the stars.  God promised Abraham in Genesis that his decendents would be as numerous as the stars. (Genesis 15:5, Hebrews 11:12)  In the same way, we all work together to be the light admist this darkened world.  Philippians 2:15 ""that you may become blameless and harmless, children of God without fault in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world.""  Let us all strive to be the lights of this world and to support our leaders as God has called us to do.",13
"Sometimes I wonder what all God is doing in my life.   I can seem Him working, and I can hear Him speaking.  Why is it that I will doubt when He does?  Why is it that are certain things that He wouldn't speak to me about?  All day Sunday, I was wondering who was going to be proving the childcare during the Danny Daniels seminar.  I felt that God had told me to work with the kids if they needed help.  As always, the faithful youth were in the nursery.  They are awesome servants.  Yet, Paul and Erin were with all the other ages.    When I arrived at the church, I pulled in right behind the Greens.  Zarah saw me and she just stared.  After I had caught up with her family, she was still staring and then her family started walking.  Finally after I started talking to her, she began walking as well.  I decided I was going to go in so I can talk to her and her brother John.  She insisted that I had to stay in there with her.  Once again, God uses a child to confirm what He had been speaking to me all day.    It was such a blessing, every child there was a blessing.  It was definitely a 3 person task, 2 people just wouldn't have been able to watch all of the children and to play with them.  Thank You God for the little gifts that You give to me.  Thank You for that gift on Sunday night.",13
"This has been a very weird week for me.  Monday night Kristen came up to me and said she just wanted to apologize for how she was mean to me at camp.  I must say, there are things I would change when it comes to my behavior towards her that week.  Yet, she apologized and I was in awe.  It was so random and heartfelt.  I owed her an apology as well.  Then the next night, I went to homegroup.  The first think little Allison Lott said to me was, ""Hannah, I am so sorry for all the times that I wasn't nice to you.""  I reassured her that she has been really nice to me lately.  She responded with ""I know but there were times where I wasn't nice to you.  And I am sorry.  I shouldn't have treated you that way.""  She's 4!  I was mind boggled.  Lord, what are You trying to teach me through all of this?  Should I be more forgiving and give more random acts of kindness?  Are you trying to show me that You love me?  Is this just part of the body of Christ and how we are to love one another?  Is this a time of receiving?  But Lord, I have been receiving so much lately!  Whatever it is You are trying to teach me, You are blessing me in the process.  I love how You use Your children - and sometimes little children - to teach me things.  I just love You Lord for You are good and You know how to give presents to Your children.  Thank You Lord for these.",13
"Last week at home group, Kim said,   God gives you the desires of your heart, after He puts His heart in you.   It's really true.  I can see it with my jobs.  The Lord put special needs children within my heart.  He told me to work with them and now they are forever in my heart.  Even though I don't work with them full time anymore, there's a part of my heart that belongs to them.  Working with them part time is a way in which the Lord continues to give me the desires of my heart.    That same night we went through an exercise where we write something down that we want to hear from God on and that we want answered.  Then we wrote what we would hope for the answer to be, what we wouldn't want the answer to be, and then the details of what we want the answer to be.  That week, my prayer was on where I should work.  Exactly one week later, I found out that I got the job I had applied for.  Some of the details that were answered: A job that pays atleast $24,000 a year (this pays $23,500 - close enough for me) A job that has benifits (yeah) A place that I can be a witness (Insight has a lot of drunkards) Some of the details that will be answered in time: A place/ job that I will enjoy A place that I can learn and not be bored A place that I can be creative Someone that I can move out with   God sees the answers of our hearts questions.  We may not see or hear them when we ask, but they are still there.  God just wants to bless us immensely - and He's really good at that.  Why is having patience so hard at times?",13
"Sunday in the toddler room, there were only two kids!  Wooh, it was so rough!  The three of us in there could barely handle it!  Anyways, during the story, I asked them if they knew how much Jesus loved them.  Joshua said, ""I love baby Jesus this much!"" and he opened up his arms as far as he could.  Then Savanna said, ""I love baby Jesus this much!"" and then she opened her arms up as far as she could.  They continued to repeat this taking turns.  It was almost as if they were fighting over who loves baby Jesus more!  It was so precious.  It's so awesome to see how kids show their love to God.  That was a completely different situation than when I watched 15 1-4 year olds on the 12th.  Cela watched 13 5-12 year olds, and she had it just as bad.  We were essentially on our own because we divided up the kids.  I truly could barely handle it!  Yet, I don't know how I would have been able to without the older kids that love to help - Katelyn, Jennah, Isaiah, Adi, and Katarina.  They wet paper towels and toilet paper to make wipes.  They did all they could to help.  Once again, they each wanted a turn to make a wipes for me - I could never say I had enough - until each of them made me one.  Poor babies (Annah, Melissa, and Eliana) that had to suffer through so many cold wipes everytime their diaper was changed!  Praise You Lord for giving gifts to Your children and using people of such young ages to bless me and help me.  They are awesome and it is so evident that each of them are wonderfully and perfectly made!",13
"Wow, it's been a while since I've posted last. . . . . .   Well, a lot has been happening.  Probably too much to talk about all at once, but I'll try.  On Christmas Eve my sister was saying that she had been having contractions for the past two days.  Chris and I took her to the hospital (because they were SO bad)!  We found out that she was almost 3 cm dialated, but because she didn't change during the four hours that we were there, they sent her home.  She wasn't able to sleep all night because they were progressively getting worse and they were coming every five minutes.  At 7:30 Christmas morning, she insisted we go back to the hospital.  She said, ""Either this baby is coming out or they are giving me some strong medicine because they are 10x worse than they were last night.  I had no idea that it could hurt this bad.""  Well, she was then dialated to 4 cm so they called her doctor and had him come in.  (Her doctor was out so guess what his replacement doctor's name was - Dr. Seymann - pronounced semen).  :)  Well, I guess he's in the right field!  Anyways, they soon gave her an epideral, I guess it's about 9:30 about.  Then they broke her water at about 10:30.  I went home about eleven because she was just going to sleep for a little bit so she would have energy later.  At about 1:00 Chris called me and said, you better hurry, she's going to be here in 10 minutes!  Well, I got there and there wasn't a doctor or even a nurse in the room.  But she was dialated to a negative 2.  The RN had thought that she was just going to come out without any pushing.  Sarah was pretty well off, but she did have to push - for a whole 25 minutes!  She lucked out but she was still in pain.  I must say, it was a beautiful thing to experience, and the miracle of birth is truly that - a MIRACLE!  After little Lilia came out at 2:12 p.m. Christmas day, she started crying and then all of a sudden she stopped.  When she came out she started crying so fast that some of the amniotic fluid went into her mouth, and she swallowed a lot of it!  She started turning blue and I think 7 nurses came in all surrounding her and taking the fluid out of her.  It was pretty intense and scary, but I don't think we really understood it at the time.  I just kept taking pictures.  So, they took her up to the Neonatal ICU and watched her there for about and hour, hour and a half.  We found out she was 5 pounds 14 1/4 ounces and 18 3/4 inches long.  She is so tiny, but perfect and complete.    Ever since then it has been bonding time with everyone!  She has already starting to show off and showing some expressions.  She loves having her arms straight up and stretching.  She is such a good baby so far.  She hardly cries, and yet it is still kind of hard to claim as a cry - it's so quiet.  She is so tiny that the shirt the hospital gave her fell off of her shoulder and her arm came out of the sleeve.  Anyways, she is a huge blessing, and my whole family is so happy that she's healthy, sweet, and SO cute!  Well, I better get more rest so I can spend more time with her tomorrow!",13
"\Fa""vor*ite\, n. [OF. favorit favored, F. favori, fem. favorite, p. p. of OF. favorir, cf. It. favorito, frm. favorita, fr. favorire to favor. See Favor.] 1. A person or thing regarded with peculiar favor; one treated with partiality; one preferred above others; especially, one unduly loved, trusted, and enriched with favors by a person of high rank or authority.  Thank you Ben for the link on your blog.  So, is it really bad to have favorites?  Hmmm. . . I have a lot of favorites, and really, the more I start to get to know a particular 'youth', they become one of my favorites.   It's really not that hard.  Yet, I do have favorites of my favorites.  (sshhhh)  Yet, each of us are God's favorites.  We can each say He favors us with partiality (it's called mercy).  So my philisophical argument is:  God has favorites. We are God's favorite. Other's are God's favorite. Therefore, We can have favorites because they are God's favorites too.  We are each the apple of His, He keeps us in the palm of His hand, He knows the number of hairs on our head, He loves us.  He really loves us.",13
"My (daughter), pay attention to what I say;  listen closely to my words. Do not let them out of your sight, keep them within your heart;  for they are life to those who find them and health to a man's whole body. Above all else, guard your heart, for it is the wellspring of life. Put away perversity from your mouth;  keep corrupt talk far from your lips. Let your eyes look straight ahead, fix your gaze directly before you. Make level paths for your feet and take only ways that are firm. Do not swerve to the right or the left; keep your foot from evil.  Proverbs 4:20-27  NIV  Sometimes I think it would be really nice for God to say, ""Hey, pay attention Hannah to what I am saying.""  I would probably obey Him a little more, I would definitely have less questions on what His will would be.  Yet, it might seem a little harsh if He did it too often.  It's just for those faith building moments . . . . when you have to take a risk. . . . and really trust that you heard His voice. . . . and that it's time to be obedient.  Yet, this is why I need to keep my eyes looking straight ahead, gazing them at the Lord.  I don't want to stumble or fall.  So, sometimes I'll take the easy road, sometimes I'll take the hard road, but hopefully it's the road that I will be able to look to Jesus for His help, strength, perserverance, and endurance to help me through it all.",13
"At times I have wondered:  am I dedicated more to the toddlers than the youth?  I have realized that I talk about the toddlers with the youth and I hope they don't think I love the younger kids more than I love all of them.  But then I realized, it's not like I can talk to the toddlers about the youth.  They wouldn't be able to follow or understand the concepts of the different ways in which the youth bless me.  I have realized that I enjoy both ministries so much and that they both bless me immensely.  I enjoy seeing the toddlers grow into their little persons and personalities and the different things they learn about God.  I love hearing 5 or 6 kids pray over the snack.  I loved when they remembered that Jonah went to Ninevah (that's a hard word to say).  I love when they all participate and listen to my 15 - 20 minute story / lesson.  As for the youth, I love seeing them worship, and I love seeing the way that some of the S.A.L.T. youth really do step up - like Jake Roessler when it comes to Darian, Zach, and so many others, and Joanna with all she does with her letters and planning of events, and Liz, Lindsey, and Kristen with the way they are so dedicated and always willing to step up and serve, and Jake Mullins with how diligent is is to clean the church, no matter if he feels like it, and James with his heart of worship.",13
"I have realized how much I love my Alpha group.  It's awesome to see some of the girls open up.  Each week, there are a few things that are constant:  Kristen - prayer requests for her Mormon friends and for a puppy. Sarah G. - prayer requests for her friends (there's always a spiritual battle) Danielle - always ready to read God's word, usually the first to pray of the youth Emily - always has a laugh attack, and then makes Kristen join in.  There are some gifts that I have seen in them and that became obvious to me last week when we were talking about the Holy Spirit:  Emily - intercessory prayer Kristen - children Sarah - compassion Danielle -  definitely has one, but can't think of it right now (might edit later)  Some of the other ways that the ""sparatic"" girls have blessed me:  Melissa - all of her questions of truly wanting to understand the Bible; her concern for the lost in other religions Kelly - her curiousity and spunk Megan - her love for people and animals (Lord please be with Megan's and keep Kelly's ferrets from running away)  Lord, thank You for my Alpha group and the girls you had Ben place in it.  I ask you Lord to continue to be with me and Kerri as we lead and show us the things You would desire for us to teach and discuss with the girls.  I ask You Lord to open us all up to share our trials and failures as well as the way you use us and help us overcome.  I love You Lord.",13
"Damian and Darian - they are cool kids.  I needed help to bring in groceries yesterday.  They were talking to their friends, but I let them know that I needed their help.  Without finishing their conversation, they stopped and came outside and then brought all of the eggs in.  They have also helped me out in the toddler room.  It's great when the different ministries you are in can mix together like that.   They serve - and I love that they help with Super Church and it's kept on the down low.  I have also served with both Kristen and Lindsey in the toddler room as well.  They both have the gift of children - if that makes sense.  They totally bless me.  I love being able to see the kids serve - and wholeheartedly!  Last night at the Renaissance, there was only 3 kids.  At snack, I asked them if anyone wanted to pray.  Addi said she did, then Kyndahl volunteered, and then her older sister, Bailie, said she wanted to pray too.  So, they all prayed.  It was awesome because the two sisters prayed for all of the children in Phoenix Children's Hospital and everyone that's sore.  That's awesome!  I think I am going to pick an organization like that to start praying for.  Hmmm. . . why did Jesus tell us we need to have the faith of a child?",13
"Lately, I have been thinking that I have been experiencing some spiritual warfare.  Most of the time when I am experiencing it, I don't even recognize that I am in it until it is over.  Yet, it has been so strong that I have been recognizing that I am experiencing it, and it just didn't seem to ever stop.  I think that it's finally over.  The past month and a half or two months have been really hard.  I have been noticing my trials, praying about them, asking for God to help me fight these spiritual battles, and in the end - I think that they are conquered.  Only through God are all things possible.  Thank You Lord, You are truly a very good GOD!",13
"Last night, I went to Central Christian's college group.  I had many preconceived thoughts about what it was going to be like from conversations with different people.  I was expecting a really big room, maybe filled with a lot of expensive furniture, decorated nicely (but hip), and filled with a bunch of young Christians that just hop from one another like it's a dating show.  (Yes, this is really what I expected)  Then, I show up.  It's in a small room, there are maybe 50 chairs set up, and I felt like the young one, where most people appeared to be 30-40.  Mostly everyone seemed pretty mature and were actually nice.  Why do I listen to other's opinions?  Why would they influence me to not to go to something where I am able to be in fellowship with believers?  I just don't really know.  However, I still felt awkward at first.  Yet, it was just like everything I have been used to.  It fits right in with the Vineyard and Calvary setting that I am used to.  Afterwards, we went to the Coffee Plantation.  I haven't really been comfortable yet.  I had been judging the place like I wasn't there experiencing it, but as if I was an outsider looking in.  Then I see Mandy there at the coffee shop.  Even though I have been with Jessica all night, I finally feel comfortable.  Seeing her there was just a simple boost of familiarity and somehow made my shyness go away.  Once I got over my preconceived thoughts and feelings, I was able to talk to some people - with realness.  They were really nice.  I was able to have fellowship with them.  I think it's awesome that believers are simply that - believers in Christ.  We can all come from different backgrounds and churches, yet we have gone though similar trials, similar experiences, and we worship the same GOD to help us through it all.  It is HE who is so faithful.  It is HE who will be faithful to us even when we are unfaithful or faithless, because HE cannot deny HIMSELF.  Even though it ended out being a blessing last night, when I got to church this morning, I became so happy.  There are so many people that I love at my church - so many people that just make me smile or laugh at the sight of them.  I am so thankful that God has allowed me to be apart of a fellowship like this.  I also love God for how He really works all of our lives together for the good of the church - both the universal and local.",13
"The Passion of the Christ  Praise You Lord that You are able to be seen in our secular world.   Praise You that You always reveal Yourself to this darkened world. Praise You that You save all people, from the beggars to the stars. Praise You Lord that You died so that ALL may live and share life in You.  This movie was very good.  It was pretty accurate, and I think that they did an amazing way of interpreting the scriptures and putting them into a film.  There were some parts that were hard to watch, yet it is no where near as gory as it should have been.  Jesus was scourged 39 times (3 separate times) - that's a total of 108 scourges at that one time (?).  It was illegal to scourge someone 40 times, so they would always punish people 40 - 1.  Yet, Jesus was not recognizable as a human.  He was the perfect sacrifice - the slaughtered lamb, that the ravenous wolves came and feed upon.  Yet, this is the only way our sins could ever be forgiven.  I must say it was very hard for me to watch some of the scenes in that movie, yet they don't even really compare to the reality of it.  You had it so much worse Jesus.  This was the last 12 hours of Christ's life, yet we watched it in two.  I don't know how You did it Lord.  You truly are an Amazing God.  Thank You Lord for all that You did just because there would be no forgiveness of sins without the shedding of blood.  Praise You Lord for Your goodness, Your mercy, and Your  grace !  Isaiah 53:11b - 12 By His knowledge My righteous Servant shall justify many, for He shall bear their iniquities.  Therefore I will divide Him a portion with the great, and He shall divide the spoil with the strong, because He poured out His soul unto death, and He was numbered with the transgressors, and he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.",13
"Who is harder on us?  God or ourselves?  At work, I don't think that there is a single Christian around me - well maybe one or two - the two new guys that started about a month ago.  Yet, it is so amazing to hear the words that come out of the mouths of my other teammates.  To call God a she and for someone to say they are not worried about heaven but they just want to make their customer's happy. . . other people celebrate how long they haven't gone to church. . . there are two mormon's on my team. . . . and others just love their sinful lives, they might not be happy, but they sure do love all of their sins.   Once I began to see how lost everyone around me is, I wanted to try to make more of an effort to be available for God to use me there.  If by some way I could be a light to the people around me, I want it to be done.  I want to shine.  Yet, there are so many times that I get stressed out. . . . especially lately.  I felt like I was yelling at people on the phone (HP, Qlogic).  I would also say things about other people that are so not edifying.  Yet, Friday one of the people I work with told me that she could tell when I get stressed out by the way that I sit.  She also told me that she has never heard me be mean to anyone.  Yes I have. . . to her even.  How could she forget the way that I was rude to her just the week before.  How could she overlook all of the times I would demand service from a manufacturer or another reseller?  Maybe I'm not yelling, but I'm just being assertive.  Whatever, they are pretty much the same to me.  Yet, was she telling me in her own subtle way that I may still be used as a light. . . can people really overlook my flaws and still see Jesus in me?  I know Jesus forgives me for my sins, but I still feel like a failure as a light. . . Yet, maybe God was trying to show me that I can still be used. . . that He can go past all of my weaknesses and still use me in my job.  Praise You Lord for that.  I know that my job has been used by God to teach me a few things.  When I first started working with special needs children, I did not want to do it because I didn't have the patience for it.  Then God told me, ""And I can't give you patience?"".  Not that I am the most patient person in the world, but I must say that God has followed through with His word.  When it comes to kids, I can be pretty patient - it doesn't matter the rate at which they develop.  They are kids, and I can understand why they do some of the things they do that can try us.  Yet, with adults, I have a lot less patience.  I think because I expect more out of them.  One day, I think after I got off the phone with Austin from Bubbles Car Wash, (I hope he's not a blogger). . .God told me, ""I have given you patience with kids, now you need to trust Me to give you patience with adults.""  Is there a better place for that then customer service?  I think not.  The past week has been evident that God has been working that in me. . . I have been a lot less stressed out and nicer to people.   Another funny thing is ever since I have bought things on my own, I have never been one to return anything.  I don't know why, maybe because I felt bad about returning it or maybe I thought the people would get mad at me for it. . . Kind of funny that I work in the returns department and allow people to return things everyday.  It was when I was shopping for my new bedroom that I started to realize what God was doing.  I had bought a sheet set at Walmart and some pillowcases.  It wasn't until I was making my bed when I realized that the sheet set came with pillow cases.  I didn't need any extra, and so I should return the extra pillowcases, right?  I didn't even have to think about it, I just did it.  I returned them.  Then, it was after I left with my money that I realized that God is doing yet another work in me.  He has given me more confidence and shown me that He can use all aspects of my job to help me grow spiritually.  He can also use me with the people around me.  It's amazing  how God works!",13
"Few people actually know about how spiritually unhealthy it was for me to be living with my parents.  At times, I began to take on my parents bad characteristics.  I took on my mom's insecurities and my dad's temper.  It's not a good combination - trust me!  Then I had an offer to move in with the Cloud's.  I had been wanting that for quite some time, people had told me in the past that it would be a great place for me to live.  Yet, I would never want to burden anyone or for them to feel obligated to help me out.  I also didn't want for it to look like I was making a big deal out of nothing about my parents.  It's just kind of hard to explain.  They have never encouraged me to seek the Lord.  In fact, when I was younger and I would come home from church camp - I was always so hungry for the Word.  If I went in my room and read my Bible, my dad would get mad at me.  He missed me after me being gone for a week, and he felt that I could always read my Bible later.  It was always more important to spend time with him than for me to read the Bible or do a study.  Sometimes he would say, why don't you read in here or study in here.  Other times, I think he felt convicted and he would say, you should probably do that in the other room.  It was always a stressful situation, and no matter what I did - I always failed them.  Now I live with the Clouds.  Even though I don't see them much - it makes me so happy to go home at night.  It is so much for healthy spiritually.  Just to see how they all relate with each other is awesome.  Last Saturday, everybody was home.  It was so cute to see how Jennah was playing with Mandy, and Noah was playing with Ben.  Then, Noah was playing with Mandy, and Jennah was playing with Ben.  They continued switching parents and playing with each other.  Both kids and parents were getting individualized attention from the other.  Then, they all played together a game of Crazy 8's.  It was such a blessing to be able to observe that.  I love living there, and I must say I never thought that I could be blessed this much.  I don't think that I could ask for a better living situation for me.  They are truly an awesome, incredible family.",13
"Thank you Lord for You are good, Your mercy endures forever.  Praise you for everything You did in the youth, for using us leaders, and for blessing us beyond comprehension this weekend.  Your children are beautiful, and You are a very creative God.  Be with us this week, and continue all of the works you are doing within the youth.  Continue to raise them up into leaders and call us to a high standard that we may be able to be examples to them.    Thank You for You are a very good God!  :)",13
"Sometimes it is good just to notice creation - to look around at the amazingness of God's creatures.  For a few weeks, I was seeing birds everywhere.  They were always doing something that just absolutely amazed me.   One time they were all in a tree that had no leaves on its branches.  I thought it was just a normal tree that was covered with leaves.  Then, as I got closer, I realized that the tree was just completely filled with birds.  Another time I saw the birds playing a game.  There was a few of them, and lets say they were in order 1, 2, and 3.  Then bird one would fly and then the order would be 2, 3, 1.  Then bird two would fly and the order would then be 3, 1, 2.  It was so funny because they just kept flying and taking turns like they were playing a game with each other.    They also seem to have their own friends and family.  I saw a few trees all in a row.  Two of the trees pretty much had the same amount of birds in them.  Then one would fly to the other tree.  A few seconds later, more would fly to the other tree.  Eventually, almost all of the birds were in the one tree. .. at least until my traffic light turned green.   Birds are seriously so facinating to watch, as boring as a ""bird watcher"" would sound.  Yet, it's neat to see that other creatures can have personalities too.  Just remember, God say he takes care of even the sparrow and they always have their food.  Yet, they were always the birds that were looked upon as evil.",13
"com?mu?ni?ca?tion    ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (k-myn-kshn) n.  1.The act of communicating; transmission.  2.The exchange of thoughts, messages, or information, as by speech, signals, writing, or behavior.  Interpersonal rapport.   The whole e-mail, blogging, text messenging, instant-messenger, and chat room scene. . . . Is this a superficial or real form of communication?  By definition, it is a form of communication. . .Yet, there are all the normal things that are usually obvious that we miss because of this form of communication:  body language, tone, expression, and the such.  Is it possible that we may get along with someone perfectly fine or even really well in an on-line setting but we might be at each other's throats if we met them in person?  Is it possible that you can't truly get to know someone without seeing their expressions and the such or even know their smell?  There is a definite positive side of it all . . . Sometimes it is easier to witness to someone you have never seen. . . It also gives you time to think and respond with prayer. .. I also get to see the different depths of my friends that I don't always get to see otherwise. . . Sometimes it is easier to type something than to say it outloud.  There are some things that we all know from each other by just our first impression of them. . . without a face to face encounter, that whole step is missed and it leaves us with preconceived ideas and notions about the other person.

Michael has had a horrible life and if I had went through all of that. . . I wonder if I could believe at all. . . . would I be an atheist if I had his life?  Does God just have His hand on some of us more than He does on others?   I don't know, but Lord, please heal him for all of the things he has been through.  I know he says that he is okay, but I just don't know how he could be.  I know he is a strong person, but please Lord, help him become vulnerable to you.  Touch his heart, touch his life, comfort and heal him.  Give him the hope only you can give and be with him throughout this day.  I love You Lord, and I ask You to touch him today.  As for Megan, she is going through so much as well Lord.  Please continue to work with her and help her not being comfortable with the decision she has made in the past in regards to her current situation.

"Abraham  Sometimes there are youth that seem like their walks are stagnant.  Then - there comes a slight change.  Abraham has always stood by his friends and talked during worship and the lesson.  Yet, Sunday, they brought friends and yet, he went up a few feet in front of them and stood by himself during worship.  He focused on God and set himself apart from his comfort zone.  The, during the lesson, he was by himself again, and he was intently listening to Obie as he was teaching and giving examples.  I saw the posture of his spirit and the hunger in his eyes, and God was moving, teaching, and working within his life.  Praise you Lord for the ways that You are molding Abraham.  May You continue to work within his life and increase his hunger and thirst for You.",13
"Sometimes the Lord does more than we can imagine.  Sometimes He uses us despite of ourselves, our abilities, and our weaknesses.  God is so good.  From time to time I wonder, am I being a light in my workplace?  Do others see Jesus in me?  Why do I work at Insight?   Is this really where God wants me?  Am I a true imitator of Christ?  Then, there are days like a few weeks ago.  Megan asks, ""So, have you always believed in God and gone to church?""  Which, when translated into Christianese is ""Tell me your testimony"".  That was awesome.  Then, there are days like last Friday.  Jason and Megan are talking about how much I know the two of them and about the two of them.  Jason is worried that I know too much about him.  Then Megan says to him, ""Hannah does not know everything about either of us.  I would never tell her everything because then she would not like either one of us.""  To them, my opinion of them matters.  Why?  Yet, they know my character.  They know that I do not cuss and that I would not used the Lord's name in vain.  It's to the point that if she overhears me say something that sounds like it, Megan questions what I said.  Thank you Lord that she knows what I desire my character to be.  Then, there are days like today that still shock overwhelm me and my understanding.  I still want to pinch and slap myself and know that it is real.  I have befriended this guy named Michael lately.  Not very many people like him, but for some reason, our personalities click - maybe because we are both open books.  He saw the Passion of the Christ this past weekend, and that began our day long conversation about our belief/ lack of belief in God.  Throughout the time I have spend getting to know him, I could not figure out where his beliefs lie.  Today I found out.  He is an atheist.  He was a baptist until the age of 17 or 18 where he lost all his faith.  Today we talked about Jesus being 100% God and 100% human, the trinity, and the neverending debate of creation vs evolution.  He shared his heart with me, the things that effected his paradigm, and he was completely vulnerable.  In our conversation, he said things like ""spoken like a true Christian"" ""I try to learn as much as I can"" ""I believe Jesus Christ existed, I always have"" ""when I had found out what had happened, it effectively killed any faith I had left"" finally ""well its nice to communicate with a person that isn't as much of a religious fanatic as most.  that's cool that you feel the way you do and I respect that entirely.  I just wanted to say that I enjoyed this very much.""  Wow - you mean an atheist enjoyed talking about Christianity and God ALL day long?    Lord, please continue to soften Michael's heart.  Please heal him and his family through all of the emotional and spiritual scars that they have.  Show him that You exist and that You desire to poor Your love into his life.  Provide for him the evidence he needs to know that You Jesus are the Son of God and You are God and the Creator of this world. Lord, I also want to pray for Megan and Jason.  Continue to help them through all of their problems.  Continue to allow them to trust me and confide in me.  Use me in any way You seem fitting.  Thank You Lord for my job and the opportunities that You have given me.  You are truly an amazing God and when You do the things You do, I can barely contain myself and not stand up and scream, rejoices that You are a God that moves in peoples lives.  Continue to guide them in their steps and the hard predictaments that they are in.  Thank You for the love that You have for them and myself.  I love You for when You use me and when I feel like I am not being used.  I give You glory for everything You have been doing.  I praise You Lord,  please help me praise You with every aspect of my life.",13
"Throughout my friendship with Megan, she has had certain preconceived thoughts about me and my beliefs. Which can be good. . . What amazes me the most is this:  We were talking about our past roommates and how we love where we live know.  We talked about the drama of girls and the different types of personalities and little synocracies that they have.  After I told her about my first apartment and roommates, she ended the conversation with ""Well, no wonder you turned to God.""  It just mind boggles me that she, a ""heathen"", can recognize that.  I was totally blown away. I think that she is starting to see that God can help us and take us out of some troublesome circumstances. . . She is also going to read, The 5 Love Languages, along with her mom.  They both are excited about it.  They know that it's a Christian book and yet, they still want to read it.  Please Lord, may You use Your WORD that is in that book to change them, enlighten them, and give them hunger for You.  I ask You Lord to draw them to You and to speak to them.  Please Lord, give them the gift of faith.",13
"Tonight Set Apart came and played for the youth.  It was so stinkin' awesome to see two great bands come together and worship the Lord like that.  They brought new kids to church that we might not have been able to reach otherwise.  It's incredible the way music can really move people and speak to them.  Everyone in this band totally has a heart for the Lord and it's great to be able to witness how God uses other people.   Lord, I just ask you Lord to bless this new band, bless the previous members of both Bloodbaught and Dunamis and use them mightily for Your kingdom.  May You continue to guide them in every aspect of their lives and with the band.",13

"Last night at youth was awesome.  Sometimes I wonder how many kids we actually make an impact on, individually.  Then Juanca came up to me and told me that he missed me, because I have been gone for so long.  (I only missed one Wednesday and one Sunday).  He is so silly.  It makes me wonder though, how much time do I actually spend with the little guy?  I should maybe spend a little more. . .   Yet, worship at the end of the night was incredible.  First, it was an awesome blessing to see Vanessa be strong and worship with her heart ""on stage"".  Then, there was this kid right in front of the stage in the dead center. . .I don't remember his name, I think he may be friends with Jared Shipman. . .but he was worshipping his heart out throughout the songs, raising his hands, lifting his head, and it was just incredible.  I want a picture of him worshipping, because it was so incredibly beautiful.  Then there's little Juanca, who was worshipping and then crying out to the Lord, desperate for Him, and just worshipping with his entire being.  Crystal Cornejo, wow, - I have never seen her focus on the Lord like she did last night.  She completely surrendered herself in front of her friends that always talk and distract others.  It was a little piece of God reaching out to her and then her responding.  Then there was Joanna and her new friends, Christine and Justine, and they were all worhipping the Lord joyously - I love when new people feel comfortable to just worship.  It's so encouraging.  These were just all the kids I saw worshipping, in front of the couches. . . Praise You Lord for the work You are doing in the youth and for the heart of worship that You are giving them.  Please Lord continue to do Your work.  I will hold on to Your promise in Philippians 1:6  ""I will continue to complete the work in you until the day of Lord Jesus"". (I think that's right) Please Lord, complete it in all of us.  :)",13

"Relationships based upon real/ superficial communication   1.There are some people that I only talk to mostly in person or on the phone.  2.There are others that I have only e-mailed and spoke to on the phone a few times.  3.Yet, there are other people that I used to hang out with all the time, but now due to new circumstances in life, it seems like we catch up via e-mail.  Someone has told me that they think if you mostly e-mail someone and have never seen them in person, than this would be considered a superficial relationship. When I asked if I talk to someone 70% of the time via e-mail and the other 30 % either on the phone or in person, that person continued to say that that would be a superficial relationship. Yet, that same person is the 3rd type mentioned above.  We used to only hang out and talk on the phone, but now our communication is based via e-mail.  So according to that person's logic, our relationship has moved from real to superficial, right?  Yet, there are some people that I know more about and have more of an honest relationship with, due to e-mail and our communication that way.  Yet, after a while, it gets drawn out and it doesn't last.  Is it just like every other relationship where it goes in spurts of varying amounts of communication?  I really don't know.    I do know that no matter if the relationship is superficial or real, according to each person's standards, God is able to use us.  We are able to be a light into that person's life and able to make a difference.  We can still show God's love and still be able to care about people.    Ben's comment off of my last blog makes a lot of sense (even though it's poetic).  A person's skin doesn't make the difference or make the relationship/ communication more or less real.  It doesn't change who we truly are and what we're all about.  What does matter is that no matter what type of communication we're using, the most important thing is honesty.  It is then that a true relationship is formed and can be trusted to be true.  People can always lie as to who they are, and that is when the relationship/ communcation becomes superficial.",13

"Isaiah 40:3-5 3 A voice of one calling: ""In the desert prepare the way for the LORD; make straight in the wilderness a highway for our God.  4 Every valley shall be raised up, every mountain and hill made low; the rough ground shall become level, the rugged places a plain.  5 And the glory of the LORD will be revealed, and all mankind together will see it. For the mouth of the LORD has spoken.""  These are some of my favorite verses (and they are in my least favorite part of the book of Isaiah). I personally really like the first 20 chapters and the last 20 chapters more than the middle ones. . .Anywho, these verses are good to think about for a couple of reasons:  1.  They are good to think about with trials.  God is able to make our way out of every trial a smooth path.  He can make every hurdle in our lives seem easy, and He can change every part of the situation and circumstances.  2.  God is able to do this when witnessing.  Sometimes we can think that some people are unreachable.  I have thought this about people at work, but yet, I have had a chance to share little things with each of the ""untouchable"" people.  God can change their hearts and make way for little tidbits of light and His word and love to reach His people.  3.  God can do everything.  He can do the impossible.  We are His creation, just like the mountains, hills, rocks...  He can do amazing things with them and He can do amazing things with us.

"So, today while perusing  urlLink Slashdot , I came upon an interesting article discussing how  urlLink cellular phone convergence devices are a black hole, eating away at profits of other electronic gadgets . I don't know where these people are getting their info, but nobody's giving away these things with their cell plans. If you want a full-on converged device (Treo, iPAQ, etc), you're looking at spending a few hundred dollars. A few hundred dollars which, I might add, go mostly to the company that designed the phone. A perfect reason to buy stuff on the bleeding edge, instead of waiting for market saturation. Because, boys and girls, once these things saturate the market and become the ""free"" phones, there'll be even neater gadgets that still have to be purchased.  In other news, folks trying to decide whether to purchase a  urlLink Treo 600 or a T-Mobile Sidekick  now have a decent guide to aid in their decision. Personally, I had already made my decision, and I love my Treo. However, to folks who don't understand my love, it's a very well-done presentation made from a person as opposed to a commercial marketing standpoint.",14

"So, the wonderful folks over at  urlLink MusicMatch  have recently released a new version, 9.0. No, I didn't learn this by going to their website, I learned it by running the installer I downloaded last year when I  purchased  MusicMatch 8, and realized it wasn't the actual setup file. No, the file you download from their website isn't the install file for ANY version of MusicMatch. It's an installer (that explains the fast download).  When you run the installer, it connects to MusicMatch's server and fetches the most current version of MusicMatch that's compatible with your system and the language you specify, installing it from their server. That's the problem. The actual setup executable is never on your hard drive. It wasn't always like this, I know I had the  real  setup files for MusicMatch 7. But not 8, and not 9.  So, if you want to download MusicMatch and install it on a machine that's not connected to the internet, or maybe you just want to downgrade to a different version, or a different language, all is not lost.  Apparently, MusicMatch keeps older versions of MusicMatch on  urlLink a publicly accessible web server . This isn't a page designed to ever be seen by customers, so it's not particularly intuitive, and I wouldn't suggest complaining to them about the user interface. Basically, the setup file naming convention is like this:  mmsetup_#.##.####_XXX.exe  To find the version/language you need, look to the first # in the series. That's the version number. All the rest are revision numbers. You'll probably want the most recent revision, as it's got all the bug fixes, but whatever, it's up to you. The last three letters are the language. I don't know them all, but here's a short list of the ones I *do* know:  ENU - English ESP - Spanish FRA - French KOR - Korean DEU - German CHS - Chinese  I'm also not sure about the releases marked ""DELL"" or ""Apple"". I have a Dell PC. I'll look into that. As for the apple, well, no clue. I own no apple machines, but from what I recall of the last one I did have, they don't run windows executables well.   Note:  These are all just the shareware versions. If you have purchased a version of MusicMatch, you'll still need to enter your product key to unlock the Pro features.",14

"Kunal Kohli's second offering (his first was Mujhse Dosti Karoge), Yash Raj Films' HumTum is a simple love story. It is the essential Bollywood formula love story, with a twist: Girl meets boy. Girl hates boy. Girl meets boy again. They fall in love.  The film opens at the airport with the protagonists, Karan Kapoor (Saif Ali Khan) and Rhea Prakash (Rani Mukherjee), leaving for New York. Rhea's mother, Parminder Prakash aka Bobby (Kirron Kher), is busy praying for her daughter's safety.  Karan is accompanied by mom Anu Kapoor (Rati Agnihotri) and good friend Mihir Vora (Jimmy Shergill). He believes that 'boys' and 'girls' can never understand each other, let alone be friends.  Both Karan and Rhea are seated next to each other in the aircraft, and the ice is broken. Karan shows Rhea his cartoon characters, Hum and Tum, the quintessential boy and girl who cannot live with or without each other!  At a stopover in Amsterdam, they explore the city and their differences together. Just as Rhea drops her guard around Karan, he kisses her, only to be slapped. They part on that sour note.  Three months later, they bump into each other at a New York park. Karan is with his girlfriend Shalini (Shenaz Treasurywala). Shalini and Rhea discover they are school friends. Rhea tells Shalini all about the Amsterdam episode, at the end of which Karan and Shalini split.  Cut to three months later, when Karan is back in Delhi with his mother. She is a wedding coordinator and ropes Karan in to help with a wedding. The bride turns out to be Rhea.  Karan bumps into Rhea again on a French train, where she cryptically tells him, ""Samir is no longer part of my life."" Karan lands up at his father's (Rishi Kapoor) Parisian house and tries to find Rhea.  Will Karan find Rhea? Where is Samir? Will they realise that they love each other? Will they be together? This constitutes the rest of film.  Hum and Tum, Karan's cartoon characters, pop up now and again. They experience the incidents that happen to Karan and Rhea — in animation.  This urban romance, which spans six years and many cities — Amsterdam, New York, Paris, Delhi and Mumbai — is an easy watch. The movie is essentially episodic in nature, and the episodes have been woven well together. The characters are also well defined.  There is a plausible, if simplistic, storyline. Like when Rhea alights from the train, she doesn't give Karan either her number or her address. Karan still traces her phone number and reaches her mother.  The film does suffer from continuity problems. At her mehendi ceremony, Rhea dances around Karan in the Gore gore song. The mehendi in alternate scenes changes from wet, dark green to light orange to dark orange. The next scene shows Rhea's forearm covered in a dark maroon mehendi design, but the palm is clean.  In the beginning of another scene, Karan is shown to be drunk and tottering around. All of a sudden, he finds his balance, walks straight, and is so sober that he proceeds to run and find a victoria and come back to where Rani is waiting.  Also, it isn't quite clear why Karan and Rhea do give up their inhibitions. Why would a girl who is so independent get close to a guy she is not sure of?  But Kunal Kohli does a fair job. The direction is tight in most places. The title song, though, is placed badly and detracts from the narrative. It can be safely deleted from the movie.  Saif is perfect for the role as Karan, the smooth-talking urban male whose main aim in life is to get every woman to date him. In fact, this role would be a natural progression to his Dil Chahata Hai role. The film rests on his shoulders. From the irresponsible 22 year-old off to America, his character has been developed well over the next six years in the movie. As usual, Saif scores with his comic timing.  Rani continues with her Chalte Chalte tanned look for this film. She has done a competent job as the level-headed, no-nonsense Punjabi girl who knows what she wants. She excels in the tear-jerking scenes and matches Saif in the comic ones.  Kirron Kher as Rhea's mother is superb, with her Punjabi accent and mannerisms. The other supporting actors, Rishi Kapoor, Rati Agnihotri, Jimmy Shergill, and Ishaa Koppikar, are adequate.  All told, a feel-good film which will appeal to urban audiences.",15

"Well Champions League final today ... was supporting AS Monaco, actually i am a big fan of Morietes ( he's cute na ? :) ) Anyway match was good .... but heartbreak for Monace as they lost 3 - 0 to Porto. Both sides were really equal, but Porto took their chances with perfection. I thought the injury to Monaco's captain in the first half hit them really hard and their top players did not perform to the occasion.   Well as far as the rest of the day is concerned, waited and waited for Himanshu (friend from school) to turn up ... but he did not come ..... Really i am very angry as he made me get up early in the morning ( 9 am :(( ) and then i was sitting like a fool expecting him :(   Anyway .. tommorrow hopefully i will get a second telephone line, and then be able to be online practically 24X7 ......    Cioa for now    Mihir",15
"hi guys,    well pretty bored out here .... got nothing to do .. except sleeping , playing computer games, watching movies..... god knows how the next 1 month will pass. Got something to do ...... i have to go to Calcutta if IIM-B waitlist does not turn up in my favour and deposit my fees there. So 3 days out of the way there :) then a couple of days to Varanasi to get my certi's attested along with maybe a trip to Delhi.   I finished up Halo today, good game ... great storyline, have a feeling Halo 2 will be even greater. Loved the vehicles that u can drive in the game, a real novelty.    Thats all .. rest later :)",15

"This post comes from the hallowed portals of IIM-C ... yes the B-school where i am going to spend next 2 years of my life. I have come here to submit the fees personally ... ( done it :) ). Well the journey was a story in itself.  A fairly long story actually. I had my train reservation frm my home town Jhansi. I missed the train by just 5 min on Saturday morning. What followed was nothing less than a Bollywood blockbuster ( ok ..... a lot less than that ... but still a lot :) ) A had to catch a bus to Kanpur, ... spent 5 hours in the heat and humidity of Bundelkhand as the rickety bus travelled to Kanpur. The other ticket that i had got after missing my train was not confirmed, i had been waitlisted at number 13. Well ... i found out that my status then was number 8, but had no chances of getting confirmed. Now i had to urgently reach Calcutta to deposit the fees, so ... i bribed a coolie on the station ..( well it seems to me that the job of coolies at Kanpur station is not to carry the luggage of passengers ... but rather to ""help"" poor fellows like me in getting a berth in the train they want ( of course after charging a hefty fees:) ) ) I had to pay the fellow 100 bucks .... then the ticket collector another 500 bucks over the fare diffrence between 2 AC and 3 AC ........ 1100 bucks down the drain :( just for the delay of 5 min ... can u imagine.   Anyway the rest of the journey was fine ..... did not have to experience the heat .... I tried to take a look out of the window during the travel ... but was really shocked by the state of affairs in Bihar ... villages on the track side seemed to be straight out of some old age movie with thacthed roofs and all .. .did not think that there was as backward a place as Bihar.   Anyway .. more of it in the next post ... am off to try and find myself some thing to eat :)    Mihir",15

"Apple Computer Inc. on Wednesday said its iPod mini digital music player would be available internationally, beginning July 24, at a price of $249. In March, the company said it would delay the international launch of the player due to stronger-than-expected U.S. demand and tight supplies of the hard drive, which is at the core of the player.  Apple had originally planned to start worldwide shipping in April. Earlier this year, the company said it had 100,000 preorders for the iPod mini, a smaller version of the popular iPod player that is about the length and width of a business card and holds about 1,000 songs. The company, best known for its Macintosh computers, has found huge success in digital music. Apple has sold more than 3 million iPods and has a 50-percent market share of digital music players.

"Lance Armstrong is obsessed with numbers: He measures his seat height by the millimeter, his food by the gram, and his performance by the watt. Such attention to detail is de rigueur in cycling, one of the most data-driven sports of all. Consider the numbers behind the Tour de France: 21 days of riding; 2,110 miles; 5,200 calories burned per day; a peak of 1,000 watts output at any given moment (enough juice to run seven iMacs). The two most important figures: 6, the number of consecutive victories Armstrong will have if he wins the Tour again (a new record); and 61, the number of seconds he won by last year, his narrowest margin yet.

"Winner of the lowest heart rate in 2004? Phonak’s Santiago Perez of Spain, with 31 beats per minute. Yellow jersey for the biggest lung capacity? Another Spaniard, this time of the French Ag2r squad, Mikel Astarloa with 7.98 litres.   The race’s lightest rider is the Russian Alexandre Botcharov at a frankly puny 54.5 kilograms, while the heaviest rider is Sweden’s Magnus Backstedt (Alessio-Bianchi) who will fly down the mountains thanks to his gravity-embracing 98 kilograms.   But the big Swede is prevented taking first prize in the tallest rider competition. Instead, the title goes to a Frenchman: Guillaume Auger of RAGT at 1.96 metres.

"Remarks by Al Gore May 26, 2004 As Prepared  George W. Bush promised us a foreign policy with humility. Instead, he has brought us humiliation in the eyes of the world.  He promised to ""restore honor and integrity to the White House."" Instead, he has brought deep dishonor to our country and built a durable reputation as the most dishonest President since Richard Nixon.  Honor? He decided not to honor the Geneva Convention. Just as he would not honor the United Nations, international treaties, the opinions of our allies, the role of Congress and the courts, or what Jefferson described as ""a decent respect for the opinion of mankind."" He did not honor the advice, experience and judgment of our military leaders in designing his invasion of Iraq. And now he will not honor our fallen dead by attending any funerals or even by permitting photos of their flag-draped coffins.  How did we get from September 12th , 2001, when a leading French newspaper ran a giant headline with the words ""We Are All Americans Now"" and when we had the good will and empathy of all the world -- to the horror that we all felt in witnessing the pictures of torture in Abu Ghraib.  To begin with, from its earliest days in power, this administration sought to radically destroy the foreign policy consensus that had guided America since the end of World War II. The long successful strategy of containment was abandoned in favor of the new strategy of ""preemption."" And what they meant by preemption was not the inherent right of any nation to act preemptively against an imminent threat to its national security, but rather an exotic new approach that asserted a unique and unilateral U.S. right to ignore international law wherever it wished to do so and take military action against any nation, even in circumstances where there was no imminent threat. All that is required, in the view of Bush's team is the mere assertion of a possible, future threat - and the assertion need be made by only one person, the President.  More disturbing still was their frequent use of the word ""dominance"" to describe their strategic goal, because an American policy of dominance is as repugnant to the rest of the world as the ugly dominance of the helpless, naked Iraqi prisoners has been to the American people. Dominance is as dominance does.  Dominance is not really a strategic policy or political philosophy at all. It is a seductive illusion that tempts the powerful to satiate their hunger for more power still by striking a Faustian bargain. And as always happens - sooner or later - to those who shake hands with the devil, they find out too late that what they have given up in the bargain is their soul.  One of the clearest indications of the impending loss of intimacy with one's soul is the failure to recognize the existence of a soul in those over whom power is exercised, especially if the helpless come to be treated as animals, and degraded. We also know - and not just from De Sade and Freud - the psychological proximity between sexual depravity and other people's pain. It has been especially shocking and awful to see these paired evils perpetrated so crudely and cruelly in the name of America.  Those pictures of torture and sexual abuse came to us embedded in a wave of news about escalating casualties and growing chaos enveloping our entire policy in Iraq. But in order understand the failure of our overall policy, it is important to focus specifically on what happened in the Abu Ghraib prison, and ask whether or not those actions were representative of who we are as Americans? Obviously the quick answer is no, but unfortunately it's more complicated than that.  There is good and evil in every person. And what makes the United States special in the history of nations is our commitment to the rule of law and our carefully constructed system of checks and balances. Our natural distrust of concentrated power and our devotion to openness and democracy are what have lead us as a people to consistently choose good over evil in our collective aspirations more than the people any other nation.  Our founders were insightful students of human nature. They feared the abuse of power because they understood that every human being has not only ""better angels"" in his nature, but also an innate vulnerability to temptation - especially the temptation to abuse power over others.  Our founders understood full well that a system of checks and balances is needed in our constitution because every human being lives with an internal system of checks and balances that cannot be relied upon to produce virtue if they are allowed to attain an unhealthy degree of power over their fellow citizens.  Listen then to the balance of internal impulses described by specialist Charles Graner when confronted by one of his colleagues, Specialist Joseph M. Darby, who later became a courageous whistleblower. When Darby asked him to explain his actions documented in the photos, Graner replied: ""The Christian in me says it's wrong, but the Corrections Officer says, 'I love to make a groan man piss on himself.""  What happened at the prison, it is now clear, was not the result of random acts by ""a few bad apples,"" it was the natural consequence of the Bush Administration policy that has dismantled those wise constraints and has made war on America's checks and balances.  The abuse of the prisoners at Abu Ghraib flowed directly from the abuse of the truth that characterized the Administration's march to war and the abuse of the trust that had been placed in President Bush by the American people in the aftermath of September 11th.  There was then, there is now and there would have been regardless of what Bush did, a threat of terrorism that we would have to deal with. But instead of making it better, he has made it infinitely worse. We are less safe because of his policies. He has created more anger and righteous indignation against us as Americans than any leader of our country in the 228 years of our existence as a nation -- because of his attitude of contempt for any person, institution or nation who disagrees with him.  He has exposed Americans abroad and Americans in every U.S. town and city to a greater danger of attack by terrorists because of his arrogance, willfulness, and bungling at stirring up hornet's nests that pose no threat whatsoever to us. And by then insulting the religion and culture and tradition of people in other countries. And by pursuing policies that have resulted in the deaths of thousands of innocent men, women and children, all of it done in our name.  President Bush said in his speech Monday night that the war in Iraq is ""the central front in the war on terror."" It's not the central front in the war on terror, but it has unfortunately become the central recruiting office for terrorists. [Dick Cheney said, ""This war may last the rest of our lives.] The unpleasant truth is that President Bush's utter incompetence has made the world a far more dangerous place and dramatically increased the threat of terrorism against the United States. Just yesterday, the International Institute of Strategic Studies reported that the Iraq conflict "" has arguable focused the energies and resources of Al Qaeda and its followers while diluting those of the global counterterrorism coalition."" The ISS said that in the wake of the war in Iraq Al Qaeda now has more than 18,000 potential terrorists scattered around the world and the war in Iraq is swelling its ranks.  The war plan was incompetent in its rejection of the advice from military professionals and the analysis of the intelligence was incompetent in its conclusion that our soldiers would be welcomed with garlands of flowers and cheering crowds. Thus we would not need to respect the so-called Powell doctrine of overwhelming force.  There was also in Rumsfeld's planning a failure to provide security for nuclear materials, and to prevent widespread lawlessness and looting.  Luckily, there was a high level of competence on the part of our soldiers even though they were denied the tools and the numbers they needed for their mission. What a disgrace that their families have to hold bake sales to buy discarded Kevlar vests to stuff into the floorboards of the Humvees! Bake sales for body armor.  And the worst still lies ahead. General Joseph Hoar, the former head of the Marine Corps, said ""I believe we are absolutely on the brink of failure. We are looking into the abyss.""  When a senior, respected military leader like Joe Hoar uses the word ""abyss"", then the rest of us damn well better listen. Here is what he means: more American soldiers dying, Iraq slipping into worse chaos and violence, no end in sight, with our influence and moral authority seriously damaged.  Retired Marine Corps General Anthony Zinni, who headed Central Command before becoming President Bush's personal emissary to the Middle East, said recently that our nation's current course is ""headed over Niagara Falls.""  The Commander of the 82nd Airborne Division, Army Major General Charles H. Swannack, Jr., asked by the Washington Post whether he believes the United States is losing the war in Iraq, replied, ""I think strategically, we are."" Army Colonel Paul Hughes, who directed strategic planning for the US occupation authority in Baghdad, compared what he sees in Iraq to the Vietnam War, in which he lost his brother: ""I promised myself when I came on active duty that I would do everything in my power to prevent that ... from happening again. "" Noting that Vietnam featured a pattern of winning battles while losing the war, Hughes added ""unless we ensure that we have coherence in our policy, we will lose strategically.""  The White House spokesman, Dan Bartlett was asked on live television about these scathing condemnations by Generals involved in the highest levels of Pentagon planning and he replied, ""Well they're retired, and we take our advice from active duty officers.""  But amazingly, even active duty military officers are speaking out against President Bush. For example, the Washington Post quoted an unnamed senior General at the Pentagon as saying, "" the current OSD (Office of the Secretary of Defense) refused to listen or adhere to military advice."" Rarely if ever in American history have uniformed commanders felt compelled to challenge their commander in chief in public.  The Post also quoted an unnamed general as saying, ""Like a lot of senior Army guys I'm quite angry"" with Rumsfeld and the rest of the Bush Administration. He listed two reasons. ""I think they are going to break the Army,"" he said, adding that what really incites him is ""I don't think they care.""  In his upcoming book, Zinni blames the current catastrophe on the Bush team's incompetence early on. ""In the lead-up to the Iraq war, and its later conduct,"" he writes, ""I saw at a minimum, true dereliction, negligence and irresponsibility, at worst, lying, incompetence and corruption.""  Zinni's book will join a growing library of volumes by former advisors to Bush -- including his principal advisor on terrorism, Richard Clarke; his principal economic policy advisor, former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, former Ambassador Joe Wilson, who was honored by Bush's father for his service in Iraq, and his former Domestic Adviser on faith-based organizations, John Dilulio, who said, ""There is no precedent in any modern White House for what is going on in this one: a complete lack of a policy apparatus. What you've got is everything, and I mean everything, run by the political arm. It's the reign of the Mayberry Machiavellis.""  Army Chief of Staff General Eric Shinseki told Congress in February that the occupation could require ""several hundred thousand troops."" But because Rumsfeld and Bush did not want to hear disagreement with their view that Iraq could be invaded at a much lower cost, Shinseki was hushed and then forced out.  And as a direct result of this incompetent plan and inadequate troop strength, young soldiers were put in an untenable position. For example, young reservists assigned to the Iraqi prisons were called up without training or adequate supervision, and were instructed by their superiors to ""break down"" prisoners in order to prepare them for interrogation.  To make matters worse, they were placed in a confusing situation where the chain of command was criss-crossed between intelligence gathering and prison administration, and further confused by an unprecedented mixing of military and civilian contractor authority.  The soldiers who are accused of committing these atrocities are, of course, responsible for their own actions and if found guilty, must be severely and appropriately punished. But they are not the ones primarily responsible for the disgrace that has been brought upon the United States of America.  Private Lynndie England did not make the decision that the United States would not observe the Geneva Convention. Specialist Charles Graner was not the one who approved a policy of establishing an American Gulag of dark rooms with naked prisoners to be ""stressed"" and even - we must use the word - tortured - to force them to say things that legal procedures might not induce them to say.  These policies were designed and insisted upon by the Bush White House. Indeed, the President's own legal counsel advised him specifically on the subject. His secretary of defense and his assistants pushed these cruel departures from historic American standards over the objections of the uniformed military, just as the Judge Advocates General within the Defense Department were so upset and opposed that they took the unprecedented step of seeking help from a private lawyer in this city who specializes in human rights and said to him, ""There is a calculated effort to create an atmosphere of legal ambiguity"" where the mistreatment of prisoners is concerned.""  Indeed, the secrecy of the program indicates an understanding that the regular military culture and mores would not support these activities and neither would the American public or the world community. Another implicit acknowledgement of violations of accepted standards of behavior is the process of farming out prisoners to countries less averse to torture and giving assignments to private contractors  President Bush set the tone for our attitude for suspects in his State of the Union address. He noted that more than 3,000 ""suspected terrorists"" had been arrested in many countries and then he added, ""and many others have met a different fate. Let's put it this way: they are no longer a problem to the United States and our allies.""  George Bush promised to change the tone in Washington. And indeed he did. As many as 37 prisoners may have been murdered while in captivity, though the numbers are difficult to rely upon because in many cases involving violent death, there were no autopsies.  How dare they blame their misdeeds on enlisted personnel from a Reserve unit in upstate New York. President Bush owes more than one apology. On the list of those he let down are the young soldiers who are themselves apparently culpable, but who were clearly put into a moral cesspool. The perpetrators as well as the victims were both placed in their relationship to one another by the policies of George W. Bush.  How dare the incompetent and willful members of this Bush/Cheney Administration humiliate our nation and our people in the eyes of the world and in the conscience of our own people. How dare they subject us to such dishonor and disgrace. How dare they drag the good name of the United States of America through the mud of Saddam Hussein's torture prison.  David Kay concluded his search for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq with the famous verdict: ""we were all wrong."" And for many Americans, Kay's statement seemed to symbolize the awful collision between Reality and all of the false and fading impressions President Bush had fostered in building support for his policy of going to war.  Now the White House has informed the American people that they were also ""all wrong"" about their decision to place their faith in Ahmed Chalabi, even though they have paid him 340,000 dollars per month. 33 million dollars (CHECK) and placed him adjacent to Laura Bush at the State of the Union address. Chalabi had been convicted of fraud and embezzling 70 million dollars in public funds from a Jordanian bank, and escaped prison by fleeing the country. But in spite of that record, he had become one of key advisors to the Bush Administration on planning and promoting the War against Iraq.  And they repeatedly cited him as an authority, perhaps even a future president of Iraq. Incredibly, they even ferried him and his private army into Baghdad in advance of anyone else, and allowed him to seize control over Saddam's secret papers.  Now they are telling the American people that he is a spy for Iran who has been duping the President of the United States for all these years.  One of the Generals in charge of this war policy went on a speaking tour in his spare time to declare before evangelical groups that the US is in a holy war as ""Christian Nation battling Satan."" This same General Boykin was the person who ordered the officer who was in charge of the detainees in Guantanamo Bay to extend his methods to Iraq detainees, prisoners. ... The testimony from the prisoners is that they were forced to curse their religion Bush used the word ""crusade"" early on in the war against Iraq, and then commentators pointed out that it was singularly inappropriate because of the history and sensitivity of the Muslim world and then a few weeks later he used it again.  ""We are now being viewed as the modern Crusaders, as the modern colonial power in this part of the world,"" Zinni said.  What a terrible irony that our country, which was founded by refugees seeking religious freedom - coming to America to escape domineering leaders who tried to get them to renounce their religion - would now be responsible for this kind of abuse..  Ameen Saeed al-Sheikh told the Washington Post that he was tortured and ordered to denounce Islam and after his leg was broken one of his torturers started hitting it while ordering him to curse Islam and then, "" they ordered me to thank Jesus that I'm alive."" Others reported that they were forced to eat pork and drink alcohol.  In my religious tradition, I have been taught that ""ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so, every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit... Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.""  The President convinced a majority of the country that Saddam Hussein was responsible for attacking us on September 11th. But in truth he had nothing whatsoever to do with it. The President convinced the country with a mixture of forged documents and blatantly false assertions that Saddam was in league with Al Qaeda, and that he was ""indistinguishable"" from Osama bin Laden.  He asked the nation , in his State of the Union address, to ""imagine"" how terrified we should be that Saddam was about to give nuclear weapons to terrorists and stated repeatedly that Iraq posed a grave and gathering threat to our nation. He planted the seeds of war, and harvested a whirlwind. And now, the ""corrupt tree"" of a war waged on false premises has brought us the ""evil fruit"" of Americans torturing and humiliating prisoners.  In my opinion, John Kerry is dealing with this unfolding tragedy in an impressive and extremely responsible way. Our nation's best interest lies in having a new president who can turn a new page, sweep clean with a new broom, and take office on January 20th of next year with the ability to make a fresh assessment of exactly what our nation's strategic position is as of the time the reigns of power are finally wrested from the group of incompetents that created this catastrophe.  Kerry should not tie his own hands by offering overly specific, detailed proposals concerning a situation that is rapidly changing and unfortunately, rapidly deteriorating, but should rather preserve his, and our country's, options, to retrieve our national honor as soon as this long national nightmare is over.  Eisenhower did not propose a five-point plan for changing America's approach to the Korean War when he was running for president in 1952.  When a business enterprise finds itself in deep trouble that is linked to the failed policies of the current CEO the board of directors and stockholders usually say to the failed CEO, ""Thank you very much, but we're going to replace you now with a new CEO -- one less vested in a stubborn insistence on staying the course, even if that course is, in the words of General Zinni, ""Headed over Niagara Falls.""  One of the strengths of democracy is the ability of the people to regularly demand changes in leadership and to fire a failing leader and hire a new one with the promise of hopeful change. That is the real solution to America's quagmire in Iraq. But, I am keenly aware that we have seven months and twenty five days remaining in this president's current term of office and that represents a time of dangerous vulnerability for our country because of the demonstrated incompetence and recklessness of the current administration.  It is therefore essential that even as we focus on the fateful choice, the voters must make this November that we simultaneously search for ways to sharply reduce the extraordinary danger that we face with the current leadership team in place. It is for that reason that I am calling today for Republicans as well as Democrats to join me in asking for the immediate resignations of those immediately below George Bush and Dick Cheney who are most responsible for creating the catastrophe that we are facing in Iraq.  We desperately need a national security team with at least minimal competence because the current team is making things worse with each passing day. They are endangering the lives of our soldiers, and sharply increasing the danger faced by American citizens everywhere in the world, including here at home. They are enraging hundreds of millions of people and embittering an entire generation of anti-Americans whose rage is already near the boiling point.  We simply cannot afford to further increase the risk to our country with more blunders by this team. Donald Rumsfeld, as the chief architect of the war plan, should resign today. His deputies Paul Wolfowitz, Douglas Feith and his intelligence chief Stephen Cambone should also resign. The nation is especially at risk every single day that Rumsfeld remains as Secretary of Defense.  Condoleeza Rice, who has badly mishandled the coordination of national security policy, should also resign immediately.  George Tenet should also resign. I want to offer a special word about George Tenet, because he is a personal friend and I know him to be a good and decent man. It is especially painful to call for his resignation, but I have regretfully concluded that it is extremely important that our country have new leadership at the CIA immediately.  As a nation, our greatest export has always been hope: hope that through the rule of law people can be free to pursue their dreams, that democracy can supplant repression and that justice, not power, will be the guiding force in society. Our moral authority in the world derived from the hope anchored in the rule of law. With this blatant failure of the rule of law from the very agents of our government, we face a great challenge in restoring our moral authority in the world and demonstrating our commitment to bringing a better life to our global neighbors.  During Ronald Reagan's Presidency, Secretary of Labor Ray Donovan was accused of corruption, but eventually, after a lot of publicity, the indictment was thrown out by the Judge. Donovan asked the question, ""Where do I go to get my reputation back?"" President Bush has now placed the United States of America in the same situation. Where do we go to get our good name back?  The answer is, we go where we always go when a dramatic change is needed. We go to the ballot box, and we make it clear to the rest of the world that what's been happening in America for the last four years, and what America has been doing in Iraq for the last two years, really is not who we are. We, as a people, at least the overwhelming majority of us, do not endorse the decision to dishonor the Geneva Convention and the Bill of Rights....  Make no mistake, the damage done at Abu Ghraib is not only to America's reputation and America's strategic interests, but also to America's spirit. It is also crucial for our nation to recognize - and to recognize quickly - that the damage our nation has suffered in the world is far, far more serious than President Bush's belated and tepid response would lead people to believe. Remember how shocked each of us, individually, was when we first saw those hideous images. The natural tendency was to first recoil from the images, and then to assume that they represented a strange and rare aberration that resulted from a few twisted minds or, as the Pentagon assured us, ""a few bad apples.""  But as today's shocking news reaffirms yet again, this was not rare. It was not an aberration. Today's New York Times reports that an Army survey of prisoner deaths and mistreatment in Iraq and Afghanisatan ""show a widespread pattern of abuse involving more military units than previously known.'  Nor did these abuses spring from a few twisted minds at the lowest ranks of our military enlisted personnel. No, it came from twisted values and atrocious policies at the highest levels of our government. This was done in our name, by our leaders.  These horrors were the predictable consequence of policy choices that flowed directly from this administration's contempt for the rule of law. And the dominance they have been seeking is truly not simply unworthy of America - it is also an illusory goal in its own right.  Our world is unconquerable because the human spirit is unconquerable, and any national strategy based on pursuing the goal of domination is doomed to fail because it generates its own opposition, and in the process, creates enemies for the would-be dominator.  A policy based on domination of the rest of the world not only creates enemies for the United States and creates recruits for Al Qaeda, it also undermines the international cooperation that is essential to defeating the efforts of terrorists who wish harm and intimidate Americans.  Unilateralism, as we have painfully seen in Iraq, is its own reward. Going it alone may satisfy a political instinct but it is dangerous to our military, even without their Commander in Chief taunting terrorists to ""bring it on.""  Our troops are stretched thin and exhausted not only because Secretary Rumsfeld contemptuously dismissed the advice of military leaders on the size of the needed force - but also because President Bush's contempt for traditional allies and international opinion left us without a real coalition to share the military and financial burden of the war and the occupation. Our future is dependent upon increasing cooperation and interdependence in a world tied ever more closely together by technologies of communications and travel. The emergence of a truly global civilization has been accompanied by the recognition of truly global challenges that require global responses that, as often as not, can only be led by the United States - and only if the United States restores and maintains its moral authority to lead.  Make no mistake, it is precisely our moral authority that is our greatest source of strength, and it is precisely our moral authority that has been recklessly put at risk by the cheap calculations and mean compromises of conscience wagered with history by this willful president.  Listen to the way Israel's highest court dealt with a similar question when, in 1999, it was asked to balance due process rights against dire threats to the security of its people:  ""This is the destiny of democracy, as not all means are acceptable to it, and not all practices employed by its enemies are open before it. Although a democracy must often fight with one hand tied behind its back, it nonetheless has the upper hand. Preserving the Rule of Law and recognition of an individual's liberty constitutes an important component in its understanding of security. At the end of the day they (add to) its strength.""  The last and best description of America's meaning in the world is still the definitive formulation of Lincoln's annual message to Congress on December 1, 1862:  ""The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise - with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our country. Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history...the fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the latest generation...We shall nobly save, or meanly lose the last best hope of earth...The way is plain, peaceful, generous, just - a way which, if followed, the world will forever applaud, and God must forever bless.""  It is now clear that their obscene abuses of the truth and their unforgivable abuse of the trust placed in them after 9/11 by the American people led directly to the abuses of the prisoners in Abu Ghraib prison and, we are now learning, in many other similar facilities constructed as part of Bush's Gulag, in which, according to the Red Cross, 70 to 90 percent of the victims are totally innocent of any wrongdoing.  The same dark spirit of domination has led them to - for the first time in American history - imprison American citizens with no charges, no right to see a lawyer, no right to notify their family, no right to know of what they are accused, and no right to gain access to any court to present an appeal of any sort. The Bush Admistration has even acquired the power to compel librarians to tell them what any American is reading, and to compel them to keep silent about the request - or else the librarians themselves can also be imprisoned.  They have launched an unprecedented assault on civil liberties, on the right of the courts to review their actions, on the right of the Congress to have information to how they are spending the public's money and the right of the news media to have information about the policies they are pursuing.  The same pattern characterizes virtually all of their policies. They resent any constraint as an insult to their will to dominate and exercise power. Their appetite for power is astonishing. It has led them to introduce a new level of viciousness in partisan politics. It is that viciousness that led them to attack as unpatriotic, Senator Max Cleland, who lost three limbs in combat during the Vietnam War.  The president episodically poses as a healer and ""uniter"". If he president really has any desire to play that role, then I call upon him to condemn Rush Limbaugh - perhaps his strongest political supporter - who said that the torture in Abu Ghraib was a ""brilliant maneuver"" and that the photos were ""good old American pornography,"" and that the actions portrayed were simply those of ""people having a good time and needing to blow off steam.""  This new political viciousness by the President and his supporters is found not only on the campaign trail, but in the daily operations of our democracy. They have insisted that the leaders of their party in the Congress deny Democrats any meaningful role whatsoever in shaping legislation, debating the choices before us as a people, or even to attend the all-important conference committees that reconcile the differences between actions by the Senate and House of Representatives.  The same meanness of spirit shows up in domestic policies as well. Under the Patriot Act, Muslims, innocent of any crime, were picked up, often physically abused, and held incommunicado indefinitely. What happened in Abu Ghraib was difference not of kind, but of degree.  Differences of degree are important when the subject is torture. The apologists for what has happened do have points that should be heard and clearly understood. It is a fact that every culture and every politics sometimes expresses itself in cruelty. It is also undeniably true that other countries have and do torture more routinely, and far more brutally, than ours has. George Orwell once characterized life in Stalin's Russia as ""a boot stamping on a human face forever."" That was the ultimate culture of cruelty, so ingrained, so organic, so systematic that everyone in it lived in terror, even the terrorizers. And that was the nature and degree of state cruelty in Saddam Hussein's Iraq.  We all know these things, and we need not reassure ourselves and should not congratulate ourselves that our society is less cruel than some others, although it is worth noting that there are many that are less cruel than ours. And this searing revelation at Abu Ghraib should lead us to examine more thoroughly the routine horrors in our domestic prison system.  But what we do now, in reaction to Abu Ghraib will determine a great deal about who we are at the beginning of the 21st century. It is important to note that just as the abuses of the prisoners flowed directly from the policies of the Bush White House, those policies flowed not only from the instincts of the president and his advisors, but found support in shifting attitudes on the part of some in our country in response to the outrage and fear generated by the attack of September 11th.  The president exploited and fanned those fears, but some otherwise sensible and levelheaded Americans fed them as well. I remember reading genteel-sounding essays asking publicly whether or not the prohibitions against torture were any longer relevant or desirable. The same grotesque misunderstanding of what is really involved was responsible for the tone in the memo from the president's legal advisor, Alberto Gonzalez, who wrote on January 25, 2002, that 9/11 ""renders obsolete Geneva's strict limitations on questioning of enemy prisoners and renders quaint some of its provisions.""  We have seen the pictures. We have learned the news. We cannot unlearn it; it is part of us. The important question now is, what will we do now about torture. Stop it? Yes, of course. But that means demanding all of the facts, not covering them up, as some now charge the administration is now doing. One of the whistleblowers at Abu Ghraib, Sergeant Samuel Provance, told ABC News a few days ago that he was being intimidated and punished for telling the truth. ""There is definitely a coverup,"" Provance said. ""I feel like I am being punished for being honest.""  The abhorrent acts in the prison were a direct consequence of the culture of impunity encouraged, authorized and instituted by Bush and Rumsfeld in their statements that the Geneva Conventions did not apply. The apparent war crimes that took place were the logical, inevitable outcome of policies and statements from the administration.  To me, as glaring as the evidence of this in the pictures themselves was the revelation that it was established practice for prisoners to be moved around during ICRC visits so that they would not be available for visits. That, no one can claim, was the act of individuals. That was policy set from above with the direct intention to violate US values it was to be upholding. It was the kind of policy we see - and criticize in places like China and Cuba.  Moreover, the administration has also set up the men and women of our own armed forces for payback the next time they are held as prisoners. And for that, this administration should pay a very high price. One of the most tragic consequences of these official crimes is that it will be very hard for any of us as Americans - at least for a very long time - to effectively stand up for human rights elsewhere and criticize other governments, when our policies have resulted in our soldiers behaving so monstrously. This administration has shamed America and deeply damaged the cause of freedom and human rights everywhere, thus undermining the core message of America to the world.  President Bush offered a brief and half-hearted apology to the Arab world - but he should apologize to the American people for abandoning the Geneva Conventions. He also owes an apology to the U.S. Army for cavalierly sending them into harm's way while ignoring the best advice of their commanders. Perhaps most importantly of all, he should apologize to all those men and women throughout our world who have held the ideal of the United States of America as a shining goal, to inspire their hopeful efforts to bring about justice under a rule of law in their own lands. Of course, the problem with all these legitimate requests is that a sincere apology requires an admission of error, a willingness to accept responsibility and to hold people accountable. And President Bush is not only unwilling to acknowledge error. He has thus far been unwilling to hold anyone in his administration accountable for the worst strategic and military miscalculations and mistakes in the history of the United States of America.  He is willing only to apologize for the alleged erratic behavior of a few low-ranking enlisted people, who he is scapegoating for his policy fiasco.  In December of 2000, even though I strongly disagreed with the decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to order a halt to the counting of legally cast ballots, I saw it as my duty to reaffirm my own strong belief that we are a nation of laws and not only accept the decision, but do what I could to prevent efforts to delegitimize George Bush as he took the oath of office as president.  I did not at that moment imagine that Bush would, in the presidency that ensued, demonstrate utter contempt for the rule of law and work at every turn to frustrate accountability...  So today, I want to speak on behalf of those Americans who feel that President Bush has betrayed our nation's trust, those who are horrified at what has been done in our name, and all those who want the rest of the world to know that we Americans see the abuses that occurred in the prisons of Iraq, Afghanistan, Guantanamo and secret locations as yet undisclosed as completely out of keeping with the character and basic nature of the American people and at odds with the principles on which America stands.  I believe we have a duty to hold President Bush accountable - and I believe we will. As Lincoln said at our time of greatest trial, ""We - even we here - hold the power, and bear the responsibility.""",17

How could I forget this...  The 11th Commandment that never made the Old Testament...  11. Thou shalt not not love The Pettit Project!!    Head over to Pettit's website!!! http://thepettitproject.com  bless!,19
"prounced: ""pett-it""   Alright, I know it's been awhile, but meh. July 6th, I went to a Fefe Dobson concert. If you don't know who Miss Dobson is, then you are a bigger loser than me... http://www.fefedobson.com. Btw, Fefe is not her *real* name, but a pet name coming from the proper ""Felicity"". Anyhow, I would not have gone to that concert if it wasn't for Julie K. who is my next door neighbour. She's a really nice person. Her eldest son, Dan, is Fefe's lead guitarist.   So we went downtown to Capital Music Hall. It was a tiny little place, well tiny compared to like the NAC lol. It was about the size of a gymnasium.   Okay so I was there, standing for like 10 minutes when the opening band (The Pettit Project) started. The lead singer dude, Scott Komer, is like 6'5"", blonde and really, really queery. There's nothing wrong with queery people though. They played like all of their songs, about 8, I think. When they were done, I was happy that the night was almost through -- you see, I didn't particularly LOVE them (at that time), I was more worried if I was ever going to hear again. The loudness of the music was well... extreme.  Next, Fefe came on and did all her schblewy -- that's a brand new word I just came up with -- w00t!! She was pretty awsome. She had one song, which she said was new, ""Don't Go, Boys and Girls"". It seemed to be about ""boys should be with boys, girls should be with girls, and boys should be with girls"", I think. I never really understood that one. I mean what does the title have to do with such a topic? ¿Don't Go?  Afterwards, my mind sort of drifted -- like it does often -- and I started thinking about Pettit. I really wanted to get a CD. So I did. I made Scotty sign it. Yay! Anyway, they are all I can listen to now. I think I know all the words to the songs on that CD, as well as Mr. Obvious on http://purevolume.com/thepettitproject/music. These people absolutely rock my world.  What is so amazing about Pettit, is that I was never really in love with rock music. Now I am. I have pretty much begun ditching rap, except d12 and eminem!! I haven't listened to much country or celtic or welsh or french or anything but Pettit, since I discovered them.  So we can now say that July 6th, 2004ce was a life changing day for moi. Très bien.  bless ye!",19
"I don't like the fact that whenever I open up my access log, I get overwhelmed by the junk requests that waste my valueable bandwidth and harddrive spaces. They all tend to attempt to execute some code, which does not exist on my Linux box, and compromise my server. Apache is not vulnerable to those IIS-specific exploits, but they are annoying to hell nonetheless.  A few google searches reveals that you can put a few lines in the config file that matches the requests to a regexp and redirect them to elsewhere if they are found to be malicious.

"C folks all love the null-terminated strings. They can do all sort of wonderful tricks to them such as inserting nulls at arbitrary positions to cut or deliminate the the strings. However, it is not the case in Java or .NET strings, where they are heavily protected and limited by their length field.  If you are using Winforms on Windows, you will notice that the assemblies are simply the wrappers of the good old WIN32 API. If you try to make a text field display a string with Unicode 0x0000 in it, when it gets to the marshalling everything after the null character will get truncated.

"met up with my sup on thurs....everything seems ok......just that my results are not 'correct'! anyway he did say 'Good!' once........although i'm not sure if he really meant it. hopefully can find the bug that is causing the logic error and hopefully have better results. driving on fri was ok....think i have a better sense of the car's dimensions....but still can improve. knocked down the pole during parallel pole......shucks first time i did that......tot can keep a clean sheet.  bought a new game....battlefield 1942......it's awesome.....the very big map plus u can control vehicles as well, plus of course the usual cs weapons. also have medic.....interesting though not that useful in single player games.  sat played pool with ed and coy. haiz not much improvement...when i try to concentrate on placing the white ball.....the potting is lousy. when i try to pot...then the placing is like shit. not easy as i thought......definitely needs a lot of practice.",21
"wow a week has past.....well funkamania last friday was not up to expectations. non of the groups really 'wowed' me....the best was KR dancers, for their humour and 'glow-in-the-dark' costumes....very innovative indeed. i think funk dancing shouldn't just be fast movements...there should be slow movements now and then....to emphasize the fast parts. if not everything will seem quite monotonous....and positioning and coordination is very important. if all the dancers move, dance together and in orderly manner....any move will look great. there should also be some interaction between dancers....not that impt though.  went to play badminton with oak3 ppl on saturday. i was quite surprised sj sms me the day b4....for some small chat. i can't help but wonder why she's available on saturday to play badminton....shld be going out with her bf. i was more surprised when she said she's sick on sat....tot staying at home would be wiser. anyway was glad she was there.... the question mark over her current status keeps bothering me till now...most probably her bf is on overseas attachment. yah one more thing.....she looks great when just waking up....  watched hero with the usual movie gang....it was a little bit below my expectations but...the story is quite interesting. the fighting scenes are beautiful....not very exciting...just nice to watch. now looking forward to the matrix sequels....oh ya.....actually got a free chicken sandwich during the show as i was informed last minute abt the show. hmmm perhaps shld act blur the next time..then can get free meal....",21
wah so many days never log...slacking liao. anyway finally decided on the courses to take this sem...after much struggle. hope the os course is not very difficult. just completed medal of honor...great game!! reminds me syphon filter...the missions are quite similar. today's driving lesson was good...managed the parallel parking quite well....no poles down....gained some confidence as well. hope to pass it the first time....  never touch fyp for a while...gonna finish all the tests by this week....hopefully i have the will to do it.....it's getting more boring.,21
wed's driving lesson: keep close to the line before changing lane...that conveys the intention of changing lanes. i kept forgetting abt that one. then at evening time went for mel's bday celebration at fish and co. wow the fish and chips serving was huge....i was really full at the end. well the funny part was that cindy got a stool for mel....low cost due to the poor economy. then all of us wrote our bday greetings on the stool. oso the restaurant's staff made mel stood on a chair b4 we sang the bday song...quite embarassing for him. during dinner heard alot of comments abt IA....well seems that certain things dun change...,21
went to sch of computing for OS first lecture...quite blur...was late as well so dunno how to register modules. but saw quite a few chiobus of SoC...hmmm something diff compared to our lectures. haiz still can't make up my mind what to take. think os gonna be quiet time-consuming but it's related to embedded systems and i'm interested in knowing more abt that. think will make decision after going thru all the lectures this wk. mel bday tmr and going to celebrate at ex-tgif...dint know where that was at first. now birthdays more low-key liao...maybe ppl are short of money to buy presents. anyway it's good enough that oak3 have kept the tradition alive for so long liao..think abt 1 and 1/2 yrs.  went to the astar website and saw some interesting stuff related to my future career. still dunno if research is the type of job for me....think i'm more a hands-on person. but seems that govt is pushing very hard for higher degrees and research. think may not be too difficult to get a scholarship for master or phd....but then i dunno whether i can do research or not.,21
first day of the last semester in sch...sianz. went to cn2 first lecture...realized there's a project worth 40% to be done...related to sockets programming. sounds interesting and challenging but tough too. tot some of my former classmates will be taking them but some went off during the break and some told me they not taking the module after the lecture. haiz...no kaki for the project. may also be good...the project may turn out to be too tough in the end. but not many choices left...planned to take 3 modules but looks like only 2 left....still have os and vlsi...hope they are easy modules....at least not tough ones.,21
"sat nite met up with wf, zx, qh, yz and jf to have dinner at the ultra ex crystal jade kitchen at taka. but jf, who's back from his overseas attachment, was generous enough to subsidise 20 bucks for the rest of us. he earning big bucks overseas i believe. the service was quite lousy...we 6 ppl had to cramp into a table meant for 4...but the food was good, albeit a tad too expensive for students. after that it was warcraft time at far east building...the most 'ulu' lan game centre and billiards centre u can find in orchard. it was quite fun...pairing up with qh and beating the rest...haha...but then 2 of them are beginners so we were accused of bullying. then we play card games at the least expected place...inside orchard mrt. through playing 'bluff' we realised that zx never lies...even when the game demands it. later we played hearts...not bad coz i learnt a new card game.  sun morning's soccer session was good. we discovered a new basketball court inside chong boon secondary sch. it was fenced up and the ground surface is good. the only problem was that.....it was DAMN HOT!!.. there's no shelter and with the 12pm sun scorching...it feels like playing in the Sahara desert...but overall it's good..we had the whole court to ourselves. then after soccer went to zr's cousin's hse for swimming. actually not swimming...just soaking in the water but there's a pool that can produce jets of water for messaging. it's really good...especially after a tiring workout...it's powerful enough so the messaging effect is there. definitely shiok....to top all that up....a nice cosy late afternoon nap at my king size bed...BEST!!!",21
well after some experimenting with the blogger interface...finally my first attempt at blogging is successful!! still in the midst of figuring out why would people want to write their everyday life and thoughts and opinions for all to see. I have seen some and wow...i was quite surprised at the frankness of some. hmmm...guess i have to give it a try to see just what the appeal is. anyway dun think i will have the discipline to stick with the routine of weblogging.  anyway to know more abt me just go to my homepage...that's all for now. btw am i writing for myself or for the reading pleasure of someone else? i haven't really tried writing a journal so it kinda feels strange.,21
watched the sheares hall production on friday......except for the sexy gals on the show.....it was total crap.....the only redeeming thing was that there were gals wearing some skimpy outfits.....the songs sucked....so does some of the acting......  starting to feel the stress from the fyp project....presenting in about a weeks times. might as well also......do a final report and ppt then just need to present again to the examiner.....  really sick of the project now.....dunno if it's me or the subject matter but......research seems boring. the past few days have been running simulations....it's amazing my computer can withstand all the processing. hopefully it doesn't crash.....can crash after ca4.....  haiz just wanna get past march......onto april and it's left only the exams......  finally graduating soon.....i wonder the feeling that i will have after my last paper.....,21
wow a week has past....quite a hectic week of fyp simulations at home. actually my computer is more overworked than me. seems like my supervisor is stepping up the gear already....starting to feel a bit stressed. he is still not satisfied with the results. i think they are ok oredi....given that the original approach is already good enough.   then the bloody driving test oso coming soon...shucks seems like everything all packed onto march. plus all the other modules assignments....term papers....tests and all that stuff....march is gonna be hard to bear man. still gonna send resumes and hope to find a job! wakau...cannot tahan liao....  hopefully can take things one at a time and finish everything on time.....haiz....engineering course so....prepare to slog for 4 yrs....which is very true....never believe my seniors but now realise it's the truth.,21
"haiz......did nothing for her during vday. actually was ready to carry out the plan on vday morning....roses and the mp3 cd. but met her online on thurs nite and.....somehow i feel the pressure to ask her out for dinner. she said she didn't have presents and no dates...which surprised me actually. then kenna rejected. at first she seems undecided...but then at last it was a firm no. haiz....she oso mentioned something abt leading ppl on. oops...is she implying that she is leading me on? and the prevent further misunderstanding...she cannot go out with me?  although i had told myself in my mind that i will not be affected by her, the fact is that i can't control the disappointment and bad feelings after the rejection of the date. the feeling that i had a yr plus ago was back....that same feeling of admiration, despair, doubt. i feel like going all out to woo her...but i can't accept the failure. i noe that a failure here will lead to loss of concentration to do any other things....school work in particular.  she is just unique....no one ever comes close. is she really the one in my life? i must admit that i do not fully understand her...but i oso do not fully understand why i like her....it's hard to describe...it's the whole package. i wonder if i will ever meet someone like her again.",21
now having doubts if i can execute the plan properly....there's the problem of getting flowers at a place near her house. i wouldn't want to carry flowers while taking the mrt....then there is the problem of whether giving her a cd of mp3s would be too lame....she might think of it as cheapo. anyway i just want to give her something different...something that she can use and able to enjoy....  actually shld give chocolate...instead of roses....coz that may be too strong....'intention' wise. chocolates should be quite neutral rite....at least won't be embarassed if i have been getting wrong signals....,21
suddenly have this impulse of sending her a stalk of rose and a cd of mp3s.....consisting of love songs. i wonder if it will be a pleasant surprise.....or a rude surprise......  in any case....i really wish that she would be happy this vday. at least she gets appreciated on that day...thinking of going to her house early in the morning to give her everything. but that would mean i have to wake up sibe early....  i'm oso scared that i have getting the wrong signals all the while......till now i still think that alot of guys interested in her.....esp in oak3.....,21
"the fact that she sms me during the badminton last time....the fact that she sat next to me during the dinner.....the fact that she tried to strike a conversation with me....are these hints that she has a liking, perhaps small, towards me??..  i am struggling with the decision to ask her out on vday....that's one. the 2nd is thru what.....sms or thru phone. icq would be very lame.....but it will seem out of the blue leh. from no dates to a date on vday itself....that's a rather big jump. that's what i want to avoid...jumping the gun.   suddenly had this idea of creating a mini-cd that has love songs in mp3 as a gift for her. main motive is to make her feel appreciated this vday...coz she may be feeling quite low. but dunno how to pass to her...wait for her at her hse? that may be too aggressive. oso she may feel strange....that is if she dunno i still like her....  haiz only 4 days left....somemore got fyp to do.....",21
"i icq msg her to tell her abt the forum thingie....oso asking her if she's fine. next day eagerly went to check if she replied. nope...although she's oredi online liao. haiz a bit disheartened....seems that she's ignoring me. so went online and started a small chat. learnt abt her r/s.....small jokes here and there and oso some serious talking. i feel that i still like her.....but she mentioned she's scared of r/s now....backing out from potential ones. think that's what she said.  haiz.....really just want to go up to her and hug her...that kind of feeling. i wonder if she's even the slightest attracted to me. think she has quite a number of suitors...i dunno where i rank among them but my r/s with her is definitely not very close. there r some guys who are much closer to her. at least that's the impression i get lar.  today went to my aunt's place for dinner....as usual every yr....and yeah.....i was forced to eat a portion that is beyond filling. that's fine for me in the past but now i dun really like to get too full....full is just enough. so a bit dulanz....they still treating me as if i'm an adolscent.....'eat more, young man shld be able to eat more'.....  this yr really no mood.....dun even bother to talk to my so-called stepsis......just wanna go home and watch epl matches.",21
"it's such a coincidence....the question over sj's status was still at the back of my mind. then as i was surfing the funkygrad forum....happen to read a thread which was exactly what i guessed had happened. and curiosity got the better of me....and i went to check the icq number....and it turns out that it was really her who wrote the msg. how taiko can that be!!...seems to me that the chance is extremely small.....  dunno why but my heart was pounding when i sat next to her during dinner on sat....i can still feel that liking towards her....just that it was not as strong as the beginning when i just noe her lar. but then again i was oredi rejected once.....if that one can be termed a 'proper' proposal....heard somewhere that if kenna rejected, can basically forget abt it liao....  i just wished i hadn't done what i have done that time....think i got out of control then.",21
"the first day of cny was just as expected.....same places, same ppl.....it's been a year but then it seems like i met them not long ago. think i cannot feel the cny mood....long extinct in me. even getting hongbaos feels like a routine...just a custom, tradition. the meaning is long gone....anyway i'm more interested in meeting my maternal aunties and uncles. at least can see my small cousins....i'm guilty of not knowing some of my cousins' names. especially those who are borne recently.  2nd day was more boring.....woke up at 11am.....slept at 4pm....woke up at 7pm.....haiz raining mah so feeling a bit cozy on the bed. played pool with ed and jw they all.....first time that i saw some of their gfs....haiz seems like only wl and i unattached there. then had supper at a prata shop opp beauty world...finally knew where that is. prata so so only......but came to know of many prata.....what tissue p, paper p, planta p......those indians very creative. even the beverages' names are interesting.....milo dinosaur....milo godzilla.....wakau......",21
"battlefield 1942 is very addictive....think i played it for most of the time this week....other than doing some runs for my fyp. there are many levels to it....so many vehicles to learn and different types of soldiers as well. starting to use the medic...which i think is quite good since i can heal myself. and the ak-like submachine gun is not bad too.  cny reunion dinner was special this year for a couple of reasons. first...it's the first time that it's held in my house...usually it's at my uncle's house, which is rather old liao at redhill. secondly...we had steamboat...also a first coz usually it's meat, soup and the same old usual stuff that one of my relative cook every year....and i mean EVERY year....it's the same. so it's different this year. lastly, it's the first time since 10 yrs that i had reunion dinner with 'mum'....now it's not my actual mum but then the feeling of a family is more complete than yrs before.  actually it's kind of boring....coz the routine for each year is almost the same, if not THE same....even the order with which we visit my father's brother and sister is the same. this year is not going to be different either....just that there's going to be a jc class gathering....hmm wonder how have the others changed...esp the girls coz just met some of the guys recently. that's something different this year.",21
well.....final it's time to hand up the fyp report. haiz so glad that it's going to be over.....now aiming for ca4 to pass. and then get it out of my mind.... then there's the exam.....last hurdle......must jump pass.  got the driving licence liao. it was posted to me.....hmmm looks really nice......got holograms on it. but then i wonder when will i get to actually drive my own car.   seems that i having writer's block now.....dunno what to write. must be due to the fact that i wake up 6am in the morning...  she's online now.....but dun feel like msging her. i bet she's toking to those 2....they seems to be online when she's online.....or is it i'm too suspicious??....anyway i'm balding and my complexion looks like shit so.....probably dun stand one tiny bit of chance.,21
well today's presentation was quite ok....at least i felt so. although he asked alot of questions...most of them are answerable....just some clarifications here and there. actually i forgot one crucial thing....to smile! i think i must have appeared too serious....makes the atmosphere a bit tense i guess. anyway there was the usual 'good!' exclamation at the end....i think it's an encouraging sign.....  hopefully will have the will to continue doing somemore things......ya need to download the papers that was emailed to me....  one whole xiong week is finally over.....phew........now left ca4 and the final exam......then it's the end of one phase of my life. i'm not sure i'm prepared to enter to the next but.....just have to take things as they come i guess.  my hair's thinning and i'm still feeling lousy abt this.....thinking of getting medicine but tot of the continuous cost every month associated with it. is my hair worth 200 maybe 300 dollars per mth? or rather is my self-esteem worth that much?.....think it's a decision that is postponed time after time....,21
"i passed my driving test!!!.....it came as a shock when the examiner told me that i passed. actually as i was driving back...towards the end of the route, i noticed him dozing off...i tot i had an immediate failure somewhere during the beginning. Actually i nearly mount the kerb during the perpendicular parking.....i just went forward and did it my own way....tot that would amount to immediate failure. also at the very beginning....i fumbled at the emergency brake. stepped on the accelerator instead of the brake!!! but other than this 2 incident....everything was rather smooth....yah one more thing is that i crossed the junctino during amber light. but i cannot stop in time.  think it's my lucky day....hopefully the ca3 presentation tmr goes smoothly as well.....this week very stressed...",21
today's driving lesson was ok.....settled the problem of giving him excess money last week. he oso dint know that i paid the driving fees in advance....dunno if he's acting blur or what.....but anyway i pointed it out and he accepted it so....still ok......  fyp project now running dry of ideas liao......tink that's abt the best that i can do.....now just compile whatever results that i have and then present to him on wednesday. think it will be a bit late to change the algorithm...  have been sending job applications through the email and so far.....no replies......haiz. i wonder if it's down the 'recycle bin'.....anyway think i need to touch up on my resume......,21

"As I begin my working life, I am starting to ponder about the real meaning of working. What is the main objective of working?   First of all, is it just a means to earning money? Should I try to get a job that is unbearable but gives me more money? I think I will hestitate to place money as the top criteria. Since I spend more time working than spending the money that I earn, the job should be at least satisfying. To me, people that work hard will spend hard. But is there a need to be this extreme? Why not work reasonably hard and not spend too much? And in the process, have some time out to engage in other more personal and fulfilling interests. Then again, why not make your job THE personal and fulfilling interest? That would be ideal, but I guess not many people can achieve that. The main reason is practicality (money earned may be less), and also figuring out what is really worth the time and effort.  Then comes the next question, is work more important than my personal life and leisure? Do I really want to forgo time that can spent enjoying life or having the company of friends, in my office? The company is not going to take care of you when you are sick, when you are retrenched. So why put in so much effort and time on something that doesn't really care? I wonder why so many people put so much effort in their work when they should be watching their children grow up, spending time with their spouses and old friends. Is it because they are just trying hard to make a living, and the jobs nowadays demand more of people? Or are they just really so interested in what they are doing?  I always feel that even the most interesting thing will get boring when you do it day in day out for many years. Does it mean that I will change job every few years? And lose the security that comes with job? Or will I adapt so well and become reluctant to switch job scope?",21
"I had my lunch today, all alone. Seems like it's going to be like that in the days to come. Actually, it wouldn't be that bad if the canteen is not that crowded. Today, the canteen was packed when I went, and everyone was yakking away. Felt really alone...perhaps it's because usually will meet up with wave people during lunch.   I think it's the pressure from my boss that's making me feel uptight. He's always iterating to me that I must learn fast. Well, can't he just leave me some space to breathe! I know what he expects already, so leave me alone. He asked for a weekly report...what the hell am I supposed to write! Anyway, I hope I can learn the basic by this week.",21
"I am thinking about the motivation to work, and it seems that the motivation has to come from somewhere that is outside of that person. I mean, he can be working to provide a good life for his family, gain recognition from his friends, earn money to satisfy material needs. Does anyone really work for the job itself, because the job is interesting and challenging? Or does anyone work to prove to himself that he is capable?  I don't think people really enjoy their work, or at least the majority of the people. But perhaps, they have grown used to doing it that somehow, they stick with it. In the end, it's the pay they get that's more important than the job itself.  For a guy with a girlfriend, I would think that in the initial years of his career, the motivation of working is to earn money so that enough can be saved for marriage. Marriage is not cheap here. Then after that, it would be working to earn money for raising children, which is also quite expensive. So for such a guy, the motivation to work is there.  However, for a guy without a girlfriend, the motivation is less clear. Will he be motivated to climb up the ladder so that girls would start to notice him more? By the time he reach there, he'll be over 30 I believe, and that age I think is a bit over the suitable marriage age. And if he spends all his effort on his work, he'll not have time to scout for a partner.",21
"With just over five days to go before I split for  urlLink Ronneby , I'm having a modern dilemma - what media to take! Ten days without some familiar sounds and visions will really do my head in, so I've been busy ripping and compressing CDs and DVDs ready for bundling onto the work laptop and the PDA.  As I'm also taking my camera I'll need to get a power converter for the battery charger, as well as some more Compact Flash cards.

"Have you noticed how many more really fat people there are waddling about these days?  Now, before I get lynched by tubby lard arses calling me an insensitive pig who's pandering to the advertising industry myth of slinky people with perfect nostrils laughing beautifully as they have multiple orgasms in their designer jet fighters, let me differentiate.  I'm not talking about people such as yours truly who have some extra poundage that could be lost if we weren't keyboard-bound geeks who didn't exercise, or your cuddly work mate who has a weakness for lasagne, or your family member with the chemical imbalance.  No.  I'm talking about those lumpy, congealed behemoths that somehow manage to hyperventilate themselves out of their groaning Nissan Micras before thudding off towards the frozen foods section with their shuddering buttocks scraping and squeaking past one another like battling mice trapped inside a sweaty pair of knickers.  An example.  Me and Gerard went for a walk around  urlLink Dunham Massey Park and Gardens  today. It's nice place. The squirrels are tame, and so are the staff. But the glory of the flowers and the trees and merry little woodland creatures was soured a little bit every five minutes or so as we were brought face to face with another visitor from Planet Michelin. We saw so many blubbery chins and felt the earth shake so many times that we thought we'd arrived at Fat Bastards' Convention 2004.  Now, I could present theories on why these people are as they are, such as abused as a child, insecure personality, social exclusion leading to inappropriate diet and similar, and I could quote from The Gospel According To Saint Oprah by referring to them as Persons of Weight Challengement, Victims of Image Expectation, Body Prisoners or some other evasive moniker. But, I won't.  They're fat people who eat too much.  And there's more of them.  And they're everywhere.  And you're next.  Just thought I'd get that off my chest.  Have a nice day.",22
"On June 1, I'll be off to Sweden to attend the  urlLink TeleCities Summer Event 2004  in  urlLink Ronneby .  It's a  urlLink work  trip, but I'm really looking forward to it as it's my first ever trip abroad, and it'll only be the third time I've flown.  In these days of cheap flights and cheaper accommodation, it might sound a bit odd for a 36 year old, fairly well off chap like me to tramping off on his virgin voyage to the land of Johnny Foreigner, but I've had my reasons. (Such as looking after my insane old mother, having a succession of crap jobs that didn't pay enough, and other wrist-slittingly depressing reasons I won't bore you with here.)  I've been trying to find information about the places to stay and where to play over in Ronneby, but can't find much on the web. I've no intention of just hanging about the hotel if there's an intersting rock formation or two nearby, and as my boss Phil will also have itchy feet I'll have someone to go 'ooh' and 'aah' will at all the new stuff they'll be to see.  Of course, my camera will be coming along, so expect lots of pictures of hairy beasts and pretty flowers on this here blog in the latter part of June.

"Well, here I am in Sweden. Ronneby is very nice, very clean and appears to be very crime free. (What the Ronneby bad boys seem to do for kicks is drive around in open top American cars playing alt.country, sort of loud.) Unfortunately, it's also very small. It kind of reminds me of Lytham, only with more trees.  The flight out was nice (after being frisked by security as my steel toe caps set the metal detectors off). The sights of the flight were clouded out (with the occasional contrails and sun devils), until we got close to the Danish coast, when the clouds parted to reveal a very, very long, very, very nice beach.  Memories of the Danish landscape included a field looking like a shattered glass window, flat, lots of farms fields, which all seemed to have a square area set aside in them (maybe it’s a law), quarries, islands, lakes and seas, boats and windmills.  Coming into land at Copenhagen Airport was quite fun, as the plane kept banking to lose altitude, which meant flying low over the sea (or was it a lake?), and I thought I kept seeing whales surfacing, but it was only waves.  After the three hour train trip, we arrived at the Ronneby Brunn Spa hotel - very nice, but reminds me of The Overlook Hotel from The Shining, lots of red carpets and long hallways.  Went for a walk on Tuesday afternoon to scope the place out, and ended up on a hill overlooking the hotel.   urlLink     urlLink     Anyway, the conference I'm here to attend is in full swing at the moment, so I've got to wrap this up before the afternoon workshops sessions start, which are all about tedious but necessary things such as interoperability and e-enabling your cat.

"You should realise that everywhere in London is a complete mystery to me and because of the diversity of the place it's an adventure every time I head in to town.  But even so, it's quite strange stepping out of a tube station in the middle of London, walking about 200 metres up the road, and suddenly feeling like you could be in some small town or village in the middle of Somerset (or somewhere equally not-London).  But that's what I managed to do yesterday as I walked through Highgate.    The reason I was making my way (fairly quickly -- I was late) through that area of North London was because I was going to a preview show of Ade's new play ""SUCCESS"" at the  urlLink Gatehouse  theatre -- a one man show written and starring the man himself.  I've never been to a small-scale production like that before (and considering there were only about 20 people there it was very small), but enjoyed thoroughly enjoyed myself.  Ade's off up to Edinburgh next week for the Fringe festival and let's hope for another award for him!    Another bonus of the night was that we sorted out who got which room in the house -- I got the middle room I was after!  Hooray!",23
"For someone new to London (or just visiting as I have in the past) the London Underground is a saviour (despite being hot, crowded and late). Get a travelcard and you can just from one place to another without any problem at all.    But the problem with navigating London via the tube is that it gives a totally skewed impression of the Geography of the place. People get the tube when walking would have taken half the time, if only they knew where they were going. For example, in the past I've gone from Tottenham Court Road to Covent Garden by getting the Northern line to Leicester Square and then changing on to the Picadilly line. Now, that probably took about 25 minutes, but if I'd just walkd I could have done it in 15. Ish.         A couple of weeks ago I bought an A-Z which has put a few things into perspective, but for the most part I'm still stuck on tube-geography. Yesterday I came across a  urlLink handy little web page  which gives a number of tube maps, including a  urlLink geographically correct map of the underground .  Nice to see, but doesn't really give you an impression of how you can get from place to another.    But also included on that page is a PDF of the  urlLink geographical map superimprosed onto a street map ! It shows landmarks, train stations and railway lines, tube stop and lines, all in the correct locations, so now you really can see just how quick it would have been to walk instead of fighting the commute!",23
"Some people move to London for a job. Others, for a better life, or to be closer to friends and family. So what about me? Why did I decide up head into the big smoke? Well, to be honest, because I was bored. There's only so much sitting around watching TV you can do without going a little stir crazy...     So how did it start? Well, for the last few months I've been unsettled and had been thinking about getting out on my own for a while, but with prices of everything soooo expensive around here, it wasn't really an option. But then I got an email from Laura saying she was moving to London for a job and did anyone want to join her. My reaction? ""Why the hell not?"". A few weeks later, we met at Clapham Junction along with Ade, and within a few hours (yes, we were that lucky) we'd found somewhere perfect for all of us! All we have to do now if finish wrangling with the agent about the contract and move it! Woo hoo!     I'm kinda doing the commuting thing, but backwards -- I'm happy with my job and see no reason to change it, so every morning I'll be getting the train out of London to Windsor and then repeating but in reverse in the evening. Doing that gives me a slightly quieter day day the chance to experience London in the evenings and weekends. I know plenty of people around and to be honest am looking forward to just being able to go to the pub for a quick drink, or head into the center and go to the Science Museum (where I've not been since I was about 12).     Until recently, I'd actually shunned the idea of moving to London as something that I would never do (I'm not a ""big places"" person) but for some reason I thought I'd give it a go. I'm young, free and not tied down, so why not experience something a bit different now while I've got the chance? And if I don't like it, well, the contract's only a year...",23
"I managed to scrape up some money yesterday and purchased  Sleuth  from Larry (of Face2Face Games).  I think the artwork and quality of the game are super, although the linen of the cards are a bit too textured for my liking.  If you hold them a certain way, the light will glare off of the card and make it difficult to read the card.  This is such an improvement over the old 3M version of the game which had almost no artwork to speak of.  I think this is one of the things that I like best about Face2Face; they take the time and extra effort (read money) into making an already good game that much better.  I'm sure that  Sleuth  would have sold well if it was just a reprint of the 1967 3M game.  The attention to detail and improvement on presentation should make this a hit.  The family took the new version out for a 'spin' this afternoon and had a pretty good time.  The game is a bit much for Julia (age 6) but she's understanding some of the ideas.  She insists playing, though, so three-cheers for her tenacity!  I also finished reading Dean Koontz's latest ""  The Taken  "".  I'll give it a 3 out of 5 stars.  If it wasn't for the ending, which tied the story up nicely, I'd have rated a one.  To me, this just didn't stand up to the enjoyment, that I've come to expect, from a Dean Koontz book.  I'm usually struck by the characters in one of his yarns.  There's always at least one character that I'm drawn to, and whom I'm interested in following.    The Taken   just doesn't have the 3D characterization that I'm used to.  Granted the tale takes place for the most part over a time span of less than a day, and the action is roller-coaster paced.  So, what can I expect?  I guess I was just hoping for more.  Perhaps a longer novel would have sated my appetite.  I'm now on to read Stephen King's   Dreamcatcher  .  Looks like alien conquest stories are filling some need.  :)",24
"It's been quite a busy couple of days.  Work has had me zooming between Providence, RI and Newport three times so far.  Luckily the day is almost over so I'm kind of coasting into the weekend.  Had rehearsal over at the Mason's lodge on Wednesday and had a great time.  I really enjoy being with the guys and learning the protocols of opening and closing the lodge is very interesting.  I'm learning that my ability to do an 'about-face' is lacking.  Note to self... Don't wear rubber-soled shoes on meeting nights.  They have the propensity to grip the carpet when doing an about-face which I'm sure will eventually send me spilling to my keester in front of everyone.  Funny thing with all of this is that I was asked to be Senior Steward, instead of Junior Steward.  Honestly, I didn't really know what each office did, but I'm finding out that the Senior Steward, among other things, takes care of the kitchen and the meals for the lodge.  I'm kind of looking forward to do that, although I'm quite sure that it is going to take up a goodly chunk of time.  Lori, though, is quite supportive so it doesn't look like it is going to be any hardship.  I've also been spending my lunches with Larry at the Game Keeper.  It's usually always quite interesting visiting him and seeing the folks that wondering into the store.  Sid Sackson's  Sleuth  is now for sale.  I'd really like to get it, but we're a bit short on funds at the moment.  I'm going to call Lori to see if we can scrape up enough so we can get it for the weekend.  It would be fun to play while at the park with the kids.  I'm also hoping I can get a picnic setup in the next few weeks to have some friends over to the park and either play lawn type games or board games.  More later.",24

Well I guess Im enjoying reading about what other people are doing and I'm finding that I dont spend nearly enough time reflecting about what Im doing / or have done.

Basically I drive from one place to the next fixing computer hardware, software, and network problems for doctors.  I guess the most important thing that I've learned from working on a job like this is to always keep an even keel, even when the client is flipping out, and also to keep the ol' ego in check; realizing that I don't know everything about computers and that each day is a learning experience.  I'm toying with the idea of setting up 2 blogs.  One (this one) to focus on the things that I enjoy, and the second to focus on health issues.    I'm the kind of guy who has many interests, but I have this character fault in that I seem to spend more time reading about my hobbies and interests more than I actually participate in them.

"The war, insofar as the major campaign goes, is more or less over.  [EDIT 5/27/04: If only I could have known just  how wrong I was...]  The majority of the troops are looking forward to packing up and heading home, and the lion's share of the naval force (3 of 4 carriers in the Gulf) have headed back to their respective homeports.  How does this affect both myself and the future of CF.Net?  Well, in all honesty, not very much.  The Nimitz remains on station in the Arabian Gulf, and is likely to  stay  here for the foreseeable future; with only about two months completed of a scheduled deployment, we're unlikely even to consider to pull back into San Diego until very late this year.  That being said, I will continue every effort to continue work on  A New Legacy , as well as another couple of non-SS projects I am working on, and hope to have everything back in working order upon my return to the mainland.

"I've been sending out e-mails to folks back home for the last few months; I figure I might as well let the rest of you know what's been going on out here ever since I unceremoniously disappeared.  First off, ""here"" at the moment is somewhere in the middle of the Arabian Gulf aboard the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz (CVN-68).  We've been deployed since March 3, and we're looking at staying out here until sometime between September and November.  Since we pulled out of San Diego, we've steamed halfway around the world, conducting flight operations, drills, and other training in preparation for going on-station in the Gulf.  We began supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom before we actually arrived in the Gulf, sending a pair of F-18 Super Hornets to the carrier Abraham Lincoln (which we later relieved).  Since that time, Nimitz has conducted flight operations over Iraq almost non-stop, supporting coalition ground troops and projecting an airborne presence in Iraqi airspace.  The Nimitz Strike Group has also conducted three successful portcalls in the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, and is looking forward to at least a few more before we depart for home.  Conditions in this area of the world are fairly harsh; temperatures shipwide average anywhere from 80-120 degrees, and our proximity to the desert makes airborne dust a constant source of headaches (particularly down in the propulsion plant, where I work; when we first got to the Gulf there were occasions where you could actually see clouds of dust blow through the plant as we passed through the remnants of a sandstorm).  We've managed to work our way past that problem, but only through constant hard work and vigilance.  We've had a few visits from notable figures in the past few months; the names include Conan O'Brien, General Tommy Franks (Commander, U.S. Central Command), Wayne Newton, Neil McCoy, the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders, Alyssa Milano, and R. Lee Ermey (Gunnery Sergeant Hartman in ""Full Metal Jacket"").  Some of us wanted Arnold Schwartzenegger to fly out here, but it looks like that probably ain't happening.  Oh, well.  That's about it for now.  There's not that much going on out here right now, but I'll keep posting stuff semi-regularly for y'all to keep up with.  Hope this'll tide you over until we pull back in and I can get back to work on the story in earnest (I've got some other plans for the site as well, but those'll have to wait as well).

In the meantime, I'm looking into new site designs; if anyone out there feels like lending a helping hand, I'd love to hear your inputs.",25
"Just a sidenote...I've been having a bit of trouble with outgoing email with two accounts, using four different programs on two different computers (my Tablet PC and my PowerBook G4), and both Earthlink's and DomainDirect's online setup guides have been useless in troubleshooting my problems.  If anyone reading this has any idea what may be wrong, I would appreciate any suggestions.  In the meantime, any e-mail correspondence on my part will have to be done via webmail, so those very few of you who use email to contact me, keep that in mind when waiting for a reply; also, I'll be out of town for about a week, with no cable connection...so I probably won't be doing any sending/receiving until I get back, because I hate doing webmail on dialup connections.

"So, I decided once again to have a blog. I've had two, but I never kept up with them, and i felt the urge to have one again. So, there has been alot going on in my life right now, and dont really know what to do ya know. Im moving away to college in about a month. There is this guy that I met, who is so awesome, and I cant help but feel good when I'm around him. Just my luck, a month before I leave, I meet someone awesome. Well yeah, today was a work day. Then I got to go see Bye Bye Birdie that Lia, Brittany, Ryder, and Brie were in. It was a really good show. Always fun at the theatre! Later.

"What a day man. I had literally the BEST lunch. Megan and I went to this chinese place downtown and we got some terryaki tofu sandwhiches...omg they were sooo good. Y'all have NO idea!

Its so awesome, i love her for making it for me. Yeah...okay day. Im not feeling too great, stomache (sp?) isnt really workin with me. Contemplating becoming a vegetarian....will it happen, most likely not, o well. Oh yeah, we did this awesome exersise today in one of my classes. Two partners one is blindfolded...once the blindfold is on, neither one could speak, and we had to lead our partner around the area (outside, across the street, etc...). It was basically a trust game, and I learned alot about how much I really trust people. Its an interesting exercise, highly recomend it!

"Woke up this morning at 10 am. Went to the mall with mom, which was alright. Got 2 new shirts and new shoes...finally! So then I went down to the Montgomery and saw Miss Saigon again, which by the way is really good. So then Kelly and I went to Peggy Sue's for lunch, which was fun. On the way back we had some good laughs. We got to her house and sat in the car for like 45 minutes listening to music. ""I didnt know how much fun a ball could be!"" LOL. Aw man Kelly...good times. I got home and mom bought me some stuff from Costco :). Very nice. I went to go see The Village tonight with Kelly. That was one strange movie. It kinda sucked cos the people behind us were quite rude, and wouldnt stop talking the WHOLE movie. To top it off they were kicking the back of my seat, o well. That was my evening.

"I relate to that girl. I know what it's like to be locked up in a place where no one can get to you and where you have no contact with the outside world. Maybe not as desolate a location, but it doesn't matter. I might as well be in Siberia for all my connectivity with the outside world.   Why do you say this? Why is it that the more I think about it, the more I see how prison could be a better choice?  1) I'm locked up by the evil witch. Well, two actually. They say they want the best for me, and I guess they do but it's still a harsh sentence they have imposed on me. 2) The prisoners get 3 good meals a day. 3) Guards generally don't harass their prisoners or nag them. 4) Prisoners get an efficient laundry system and a TV in every room. 5) Prisoners don't have to work. They are generally free to do what they want. 6) They get an hour out a day. 7) If their behaviour is deemed satisfactory, they are able to apply for a 48hr pass with a hope that it might be approved.  Fantastic eh? Suddenly, the penitentiary seems a much more appealing option.",27
My old one got found out so here I am. Again. With a completely new URL in the hope that they won't be able to find it and discover the details of the secret life of me.,27
"Okay, it's here again and whilst, in other years, it would've been a cause for celebration as it would mean a period of rest and recreation, the fact that we're in the final year of school means that it's just as they call it. A ""non-instructional period"". Which is just a fancy term for not being required to be at school but where we're still required to do as much as, if not more, work then normal. Oh well.  Other than that, being back in Singapore is the same as usual. Parents are being as annoying as can be expected and constantly bugging me about things which I do. They gripe about my hair being too long/bushy/unkempt/thick/outlandish and chiding me about my future. Basically just the usual things which all parents do. It's just a constant battle and argument with them about things like freedom and the like. Nothing that most of you don't already know about.   Moving along, I had this weird dream last night. Like an epiphany but not quite as intense nor lucid. Peculiar how my dreams are always some abnormal event occuring. Anyway, for some reason, I dreamt I was married. Yes. I know I spoke about marriage before but hear me out first.  Anyway. Chris, I think I told you about this. Well.. Part of it anyway. I didn't feel quite right about telling you the whole thing just yet, but heres the rest of it. My memory's a little hazy, but as far as I can remember, I dreamt that I came home, wearing a suit no less and I was living in a dreamy South Yarra townhouse. Modern/contemporary architecture, futuristic design and all. Anyhow, I'm standing at my door in a suit, some expensive tailored one because I kept adjusting it and making it straight and all. Or maybe it was just my vanity, I'm not entirely sure. Guess who answers the door? That's right. Miss You-Know-Who. No, not the one you guys are thinking of. Chris knows who I mean. I hate using names. And I suspect I might have given her the URL to this. I'm not sure. But I'm not taking any chances. Anyway, there's the flurry of hugs and kisses as the lady literally pounces on me. Yes yes, then there's the exchange of sweet-nothings and ""I miss you"" and ""I love you"" and yada yada yada. I'll spare you the details.  Later on in the dream, I use the toilet and as I wash my hands, I see A FUCKING WEDDING RING. Just like the one I always had in mind, platinum with a small diamond inset. Don't ask me how I know, I just do. Keep in mind however, that I was dreaming at the time and all this happening was perfectly normal to me and I did not once think that anything was out of place. Till I woke up.  Now, there's a portion of the dream which I'm afraid I'm going to leave out due to sheer embarassment, but as I said. Chris, you already know the other bit. Dear Lord. Pardon me for dreaming of things like that, but you know I can't help it. It was good though. Enjoyable... Mmmmmm...",27
"It’s that time of the day again, the time where I lie in bed and try to induce a sort of sleep upon my body, except I know that it’s no use and I’ll just be spending the next hour or so lying in bed reflecting, having a myriad of different thoughts through my mind. Only difference with tonight would be that I brought my laptop to bed, with the intention of listening to music, but here I am writing this out.  For some reason however, that familiar yearning is back – the one which was originally so devoid and empty. Maybe it’s the music I’m listening to, the familiar saxophone notes and piano harmonics, the sweet melody fills my mind and my thoughts then happen to befit the music.  Why not listen to hip-hop or something you ask. Nah, that stuff wakes me up and I need my rest. Although sleep is just a temporary reprieve from this existence I suffer from, a momentary escape from the malady.   I miss that. I think the feeling has always been there, except I never admitted it or neither would I have done so. Well, I am now, but oh well… I think I miss knowing that there’s someone out there who tells you “I love you” and means it. Specifically, someone whom you love as well. Yada yada yada, I know I bitch and gripe about “What the fuck is love anyway?”. But give me this once, to whine about something else.  I don’t know what you [ie. The reader] looks for in a relationship. And truth be told, neither do I. I’d just be feigning wisdom and maturity if I pretended to know, although I do have a hunch of what I look for. However, it’s a theory, and no more than that.  In all my relationships, I always enjoyed the feeling that I had someone there for me. Someone whom upon meeting, there would be a flurry of hugs and kisses, but more than the physical motions, there would be an emotional connection. One in which we both knew we were special and one in which we were both completely happy with each other.  A friend of mine [who doesn’t have this URL but will still remain nameless] told me a few days [or was it yesterday…] that it was the worst feeling in the world to be with someone, and yet still feel lonely. How did that particular conversation come about you ask? To be frank, it was completely unexpected… she asked how I was feeling, to which I replied “I’m cold. Miserable [domestic issues for the more curious of you]. Lonely [I’ve gone back to Kelly. My pillow] and not feeling well at all, thank you very much.” Here she was, a girl already with a boyfriend, who replied [after a few messages] that she still felt lonely around him.   Her answer surprised me, as this particular girl had been in a relationship with her boyfriend for a year and 2 months now. Or a year and 3 months, whichever, I don’t really pay attention. Anyhow, I wondered how you could last with someone for so long without feeling happy around them. For all the girls I’ve been with/gone out with/were a notch more than friends with, I’ve always felt happiest around a girl whom I’ve loved. Oh, and she loved me accordingly, reciprocating the affection. I couldn’t understand her answer, how her boyfriend and her could claim to love each other and wish to get married to each other [I’ve already talked about this. Read below] and how she could still feel lonely around him.   It still confounds me, to tell the truth, I don’t know why she told me that, or how to take it when she said that she only feels happy around yours truly. First off, she’s got her boyfriend, and I think it’s an evil thing to ruin a relationship. As such, I steered away from it, laughing it off as a joke, albeit a twisted one and the awkward silence which followed.   Girls. There’s just no understanding them.",27
"Again, I start off with my disclaimer, the one that states I don't intend to be arrogant and to blow my own horn, yada yada, that this is just a series of my thoughts, blah blah. You get the point.   Down to business. Someone I spoke to today mentioned that while I'm usually rather mature [hey, her misconception, not mine], on occasion, I am impossibly and unbelievably immature. Me being me, of course, asks for an elaboration of her point and she reported that it was the way I act and the things I talk about. Not so much the way I dealt with things, although my methods of dealing with somethings aren't terribly mature, a fact which I'd readily admit to.  And now, lying in bed at 1.40 in the morning [thank God for wireless internet], I finally think about it and say ""Fuck maturity"". Fuck acting old and fuck being wise. If I'm a child, so be it. I'm quite happy to remain that way to tell the truth. As a child, I never had anything to really worry about, except maybe for how many toys I had. And even then, it was a minor issue, nothing which sure, I might've cried over [Man. Action Man toys meant the world to me back then], but nothing that left deep running scars.  Now however, with my sudden forceful thrust into a more mature world [well. More mature than Power Rangers and GI Joe's, that's for sure], I find myself wanting to revert back to my childhood days. Ignorance truly is bliss, if I don't know it, it can't hurt me! Oh sure, you suffer from the fact that you don't know anything about the 'real world', but the good bit of it is that you don't even know that! Okay, that might sound confusing, lemme simplify it for you.  You don't know that you don't know anything. Which basically means, you don't miss out on anything! How fantastic is that? Apart from the facts we face now, where we acknowledge that there's a lot we don't know and for all that we know, we already know too much. We aren't afraid of physical wounds anymore, a bruise or stab wound is temporary, scars heal over and modern medicine works wonders for cover ups. Botox injections, boob jobs, skin grafts. We won't have to worry about physical blemishes in the next 10yrs. However, the scars which really matter, those that make an impact would be the emotional ones. There's no judge of how long it takes to heal and most of all, because it hurts at the worst times. Physical scars can be ignored, but emotional scars would always be at the back of your mind. Or mine at least.   And that sucks. Even then, my emotional scars wouldn't be any worse than what the next teenager has to deal with. Nothing overtly dramatic has happened in my life, a fact which I'm grateful for, and I certainly don't wish anything like that to happen. But then you stop to think ""If this guy, whom nothing major really happens to can be so fucking cynical about everything, how about a person whom deep shit has happened to?""  Certainly makes you think twice about saying something to a person whose parents died in a car accident when they were 2yrs old doesn't it? Same with a person who faces a medical problem and is that way because they were born like that. So do the world a favour, think before you speak or do anything. I know I don't really do that, but hey, I'm trying. Give me that.  Funny thing is, it's all part of growing up. This whole ""How to be a person"" bullshit. Peter Pan! Come take me away! Fly me to Neverland! I promise not to join Captain Hook!",27
"Being sentient creatures, humans in general worry about the future. Generally, we think about a particular facet of our lives, chiefly our career direction, spouse and the like. Most people think about 5 or 10 years ahead, anything beyond that being too far away to worry about, although we do contemplate the future in moments of boredom. Or at least, I do anyway. Yet I wonder though, for all the dreams and ambitions we have, how many would come true?  Even now, I look at some of the relationships my friends hold [No. this isn’t directed at anyone in particular, so don’t bug me about it.] and I notice a particular trend going around that after about 3 or 4 months, both parties in the particular relationship would say that they would like to marry each other. I have relatively little doubt that its an insincere statement. For those who say it, I’m sure they really do desire a marriage or at least, a long term relationship with the other person. What I doubt however, is the likelihood of it happening.   Every single relationship I’ve had [specifically. The serious ones where I actually felt something for her, whoever she is], I’ve been prepared to marry the girl involved. I think there would only be two of such relationships, where I actually desired a long term thing with them and not some 1 or 2 week thing which happens. Well the want for them was there, I admit that it was an unrealistic dream. Not that I would’ve admitted it at the time, but gifted with hindsight now, I grudgingly concede. I’m about 16yrs old now and all of you are older than I am, although not significantly [ie. More than 5yrs] and everything I say from here is an assumption. Believe you me, I’m quite happy for those attached among you to stay with your current squeeze, marry him/her and then go have your kids somewhere. Whichever.   What I ask though is the likelihood at which that would happen. This would probably be directed towards the most sentimental amongst you, those who talk about marriage as if it were a week away and it is inevitable. Those of you who claim to be deeply in love with each other [hey. I admit I still don’t know what love is, although I think I’ve got a general idea of the outline] and who forget that marriage is probably about a good 10 years away for all of us.  Pardon my cynicism, but I can’t help but wonder what would happen in not something as long as the next 10 years, but only the next 2 years… or one, for that matter. Human life is fragile, anything could happen at anytime. Fate could deal a bad card and one side of your relationship would suffer a fatal and tragic accident. Boohoo. Or maybe it won’t be as dramatic as that and “shit happens” and the relationship falls apart.   I could come up with any number of scenarios illustrating my point, but basically the message is the same. I, personally [and again, this is my opinion and I might be wrong] think that relationships that occur at this age won’t last. And even for those that do, how long would they last for? I’ve never seen or heard of a relationship [and this might be due to sheer ignorance] that lasted from the age of 18 onwards till adulthood and into marriage. Oh sure, you get tabloid reports of childhood sweethearts meeting after 20years and reigniting a spark. But how many actually last the 10 year wait till marriage?   Then again, I do concede that it’d be kinda cute if someone really did get married after 10 years in a relationship together. But I think romantic stories like those have been lost in literature, never coming out and manifesting itself in the real world. Go ahead somebody. Prove me wrong. Stay with him/her till a suitable marriageable age [ie. When both of you have careers and all] and get married. And stay married.   I understand the obvious difficulty in agreeing with what I have just said [if you do] and then actually saying it out. I imagine in a moment of amorousness, it would spoil the roses to say “Nah. I don’t think we’ll get married. It’s too far away to think”. Of course, it’d be much simpler [and less tear filled too, might I add] to say “Yeah. And we’ll have kids and name them X and Y”. Even if both parties do know that it’s the reality of things, they usually are intelligent enough to know that it’d cause a moment of awkwardness and silence, the type caused by mentioning taboo subjects like a possible break up. And as we all know… Simplicity is often the way to go with things.   Don’t get me wrong, I’m not asking you all to go out and tell your significant other how I feel about this. It’s my opinion, and I guess for all the women I’ve cared about, I’ve had bad experiences with.   Which brings me to bitch. Why is it only the women I care for whom I have had bad experiences with… I think I’ll leave this one for another day.",27
"Dum dum dum... Another boring Saturday afternoon and the first this year which I've slept past noon. Well... I guess I overdid it, waking up at 4 in the afternoon. Thats pretty much my whole day gone. Not only that, its about 6pm now and I'm still feeling tired.   Sure as hell makes me wonder why I bothered getting up in the first place.  Anyway. This new wave of lethargy can't be good. For all my late night/early morning shennanigans, I was always enthusiastic enough to wake up early morning and do my work. Oh sure, it wasn't as high a standard of work as it should be, but hey, fact is that I did get up to do my work anyway.   Nowadays however, even without the late night... mucking around I carried out before, I constantly feel tired throughout the day. Sleep isn't really a problem, within minutes of lying in bed, I've entered Dreamland. I assume with 6-8hrs a night, I'm getting enough sleep for any adolescent [although some might beg to differ, but those are just abnormal cases] and I shouldn't be feeling as tired as I do.   Oh well... 144 more days till my exams are over. And at the end of the physics exam, I wonder if I'll have the thought at the back of my head, that burning sensation which says ""You do know that you didn't do your best. And because of that, you might potentially suffer for the rest of your life because of a moment's laziness"".  Damn.",27
"I have ceased to care and I'm adopting an casually-indifferent attitude to this shit. For some reason, I figured that it's worse than being annoyed or pissed off. At least if I was frustrated, it'd show I still cared about it. Sure it's a step down from being happy but hey, better some care than don't care right?  I guess I still DO care. Even that tiny teensy little wee bit. Or enough for me to bother asking ""Why the fuck do I bother anymore""  And to those of you who are going to ask me ""What happened?"", nothing did. Nothing in particular happened. I just can't be fucked anymore.",27
"Yes yes, I know X'mas is a good long way away, but I guess there's not much harm in writing a list of what I want is there? I figured with the amount of wish lists Santa gets, if I write mine now, then he could prepare it early and I could beat the hordes of kids who write to him.  Anyhooo. They're as follows.  1) Panasonic X70 [That's one funky ass phone]  2) A self updating directory of music. The latest hiphop and a touch of jazz music. Not to mention all the songs I've ever wanted to listen to but could never find.   3) New set of speakers. [Not to mention a desk to put it on]  4) A white tuxedo [ie. the suit, a white shirt, white leather shoes and the black belt. Chuck in a pair of sunglasses as well.]  5) A black BMW. Specifically, the M3 or any two door sports series BMW. But preferably the M3.   6) A diamond earring in my left earlobe. [Just to go with the black BMW and the white tux]  7) World peace [I'll chuck this one here so that you won't think I'm completely selfish and don't think of the world. Well. Actually. I probably AM that selfish. But who cares]  8) Nike Year of the Monkey Air Force Ones.  9) Black NY cap along with the white bandana to fit under the cap.  10) A whole new wardrobe. [ie. 20 more t-shirts, 5 new pairs of pants, 10 new jackets and 10 pieces of headgear. That should do the trick.]   11) Oooh. A host of accessories. Like dog chains, bangles, scarves. That kind of thing.  12) Make that two new wardrobes. One would be street gear, and the other would have the formal wear. The... more presentable gear I'll use to meet parents and all that. Wardrobe two would be composed of the Polo Ralph and all that.  Pretty please Santa?",27
"Metaphysics is a rather obscure branch of philosophy which examines the nature of reality and the relationship between mind and matter. Most people, unfortunately, take for granted that reality exists; that some kind of perfect (again I slip in a note that it is subjective) world lies beyond the realm of imperfect manner [ie. Our realm]. In a religious manner of speaking, this perfect world is termed Heaven some other word describing the domain of the spirit. In Western philosophy, metaphysical reality is patterned after Plato’s world of perfect forms from which our senses draw a distorted image of the true reality.  If this realm exists, how do we know it’s there? It is a hypothetical construct, inaccessible to our senses but we believe, foolishly or otherwise, that it is there. Christians look at the Bible as a book of law; a constant in this malevolent world of ours where everything is unpredictable and often, the most unexpected happens unless we are fortunate enough to be gifted with foresight. As such, Christians believe the existence of a realm like Heaven simply because “the Bible said so” and because they have been led to believe of its existence. This is not to say that I’m an atheist, although what I’m saying might be considered to be in support of atheism, maybe even sacrilegious. Deep down, I am a Christian, albeit not a very strong one and whilst my faith is still shaky and I’m far from being a crucifix wearing zealot, I still have some faith in the Lord.    However, I still struggle with my faith. To believe or not to believe; I can’t answer that question seeing as I really don’t know. On some occasions of my life, I appear to have been let down by Christ. Where some people might say that “It’s all part of the plan”, I believe in direct methods of dealing with things. However, on some events in my life, I wonder if they occurred because of chance or because a higher power had caused events to occur that way.  Just some food for thought.",27
"Some people asked me why I had decided to put ""Free Jono"" on the back of my Year 12 jumper. Well, first off, it's an ambiguous phrase which has meaning both during my lockdown period and after.  If you choose to look at the word ""Free"" as a verb [ie. an action word], then it's a plea for freedom. A message on the back of the jumper which means by wearing the jumper, I'm asking for my freedom back. For liberation and final emancipation from my jail wardens. Awhile back, I likened myself to being locked in a penintentiary where I had my jail wardens and so on and so forth. By wearing the jumper, it's like a protest against them and whilst a worthless and useless method of peaceful protest, a method nonetheless.  However, should you chose to look at the word ""Free"" as an adjective [ie. a describing word], a whole different meaning takes place. That second meaning will come into effect only after my Year 12 exams are well and truly over and the moment they say ""You are dismissed"" at about 10.45 in the morning on the 10th of November 2004... I'll be free.   Hence my reason for choosing that as a logo on the back of my jumper. To remind myself, even in my old age [if I decide to keep the damn thing] about my situation in Year 12.",27
"For those of you on Friendster, and most of you are, you see that whenever I complete a questionaire where they ask ""Are you in love"" or ""Ever been in love"", I always reply with a question of my own or claim that I don't know the meaning of love and what it entails. If I cannot even begin to define it, how can I claim to be in it?  Anyhow, this morning, after reading a quiz written by a friend, I came up with a few statements and questions to help us figure out what this whole Love thing is about.    Love is not about what you are prepared to do for the other person   People are limited by physical and financial means and some other person might be able to carry out a task with relative ease what another person might find an impossible task.  [ie. An olympic runner would be able to run 100km with ease whereas a paraplegic might find it exceedingly difficult. No wait. Impossible. Same as a billionaire would be able to buy a villa whereas a street bum might not even be able to guarantee a meal.]  But that doesn't mean the other one who can't provide the same amount or more loves her  [and I use ""her"" because I'm a male. So I talk about things from the male side of the show. Sue me all ye feminists].  While a person probably  would  do more for a person he loves, this is not necessarily the case and a definition has to be universal and this rule would not apply to everyone.   Love rather, is about what you'd be prepared to give up   Now Jana, this was the purpose of my question. I hypothesized awhile ago that to love a person would mean wanting them to be happy even at your own expense and this one explains it. Not only the materialistic physical or financial means as aforementioned. I think the most important sacrifices are made in intangible means. Money can be re-earned and energy regained, heck, even physical scars can be 'fixed' by means of modern day surgery  [they can even make you look like me now. God forbid, naturally. But the option is there should you choose to want a permanent Halloween mask] . However, emotional scars never ever go away. Whilst they aren't visible, we know they're there and they continue to hurt more intensely and for longer than physical ones do.   Love is about acceptance   If Ken told me he loved Jane  [fictitious names. I don't know anyone by those names and thank God for that]  but that he rather she'd be smarter or that she'd be prettier, I'd question  [maybe not to his face, but certainly at the back of my mind]  if he really loved her or not. I think that to love someone means accepting them for who they are, and whilst I'm not so bold as to claim that it means that you don't love them, I'd wonder if you really do love them as much as you say you do if you can't accept them for them. I would think however, that you're in love with who you want them to be and not them. Confusing, I'll grant you, but stop to think about it and just maybe you'll get the gist of what I'm trying to say. Pardon my ineloquence.  That's a slight idea of what goes on in my head sometimes. I've got more on the way but I can't really be fucked typing them all out and don't get me wrong. I'm not THAT arrogant to say that I have now defined Love and given a universal definition to it. It's just some rules that I've come up with and like always, I might be wrong. And rules were meant to be broken anyway.",27
"Last night, I was lying in bed, and as all normal people do, I found myself quickly slipping into a state of drowsiness and then into sleep. From sleep, I passed through the dreamless state and entered Dreamland. The place where we enjoy ourselves and relive our deepest desires, survive our worst nightmares and well, to cut a MELODRAMATIC story short, it's a place where what happens there, generally stays there and we don't give it much thought in our waking hours.  Anyhow, last night, I had a dream which I felt was... weird [My kingdom for a more eloquent word!]. More interestingly, it was centered around a particular person. She-who-shall-not-be-named. God I feel stupid using that. Damn you J.K. Rowling. For the purpose of displaying the abnormality of the dream, I had another one just last week centered around the same general idea. I'll explain in order of sequence [or what I think is the sequence in which they occured].   Last night, the dream was of me. Standing alone in a dimly lit carpark where I was by myself. Wearing funky clothes too mind you. All of a sudden, she walks up to me and for no rhyme or reason I said ""Kiss me"" [When I woke, I thought about the stupidity of the statement and just wondered why I said, of all things, that. Not even a greeting or a pleasantry. A simple two words]. Here's the clincher. She did. Oh, sure it happened in a dream, but I'm surprised that my mind, despite my wild imagination and twisted thought processes, could come up with that. I was [in my dream] understandably confused as to why she did and proceeded to ask her about her boyfriend.  ""He never loved me, he just used me [Nb. Here I cringed in my dream and felt a stab through my heart. Emotional knife 101] and I don't know why I ever loved him... I should never have taken you for granted and I'm so sorry about that, would you ever forgive me?""  Well. Um. Here, I say ""I don't know... I've got a lot of questions I need answering. Like why did we -break- in the first place.""  ""You never show how much you cared [Nb. b-u-l-l-s-h-i-t. I think, in the real world, I displayed how much I cared for her enough. I think. But that led me, upon waking, to realise the dream was complete and utter horseshit.] and we could never see each other... I didn't want to be ditched for someone else; you know me... I don't like being ditched and I thought I had to ditch you first.""  ""Fine. But you do know that I would've waited for you forever and ever if it came down to it... And you just had to tell me how you felt. That's all you had to do hun [eh wtf.]...""  And then more hugging and reconcilation and we kiss again.  So that was the dream last night.  The dream the previous week, was one where you [this is to Chris and Jana], her and I were on a double date. We were walking along Collins Street, in the city, and it was just like old times. More laughing and smiling. And everyone was happy; nothing in the world was wrong and it couldn't have been more perfect. Chris and Jana were in the front, walking and holding hands with each other [as they always fucking do] and here and I were up the back whispering sweet-nothings to each other, her head resting on my shoulder.   Now, I don't know about what you think. But here and now, I solemnly swear that I have no more emotions [at least not in that way] for the girl. Sure, I think about her at night [but hey, I even think about randoms] but I don't think it'd be anything abnormal. Honestly, tell me you've never thought about relationships long past at night whilst lying in bed and just reminscing.   And on both occasions, I woke up, scratching my head and thinking I have the most fucked up mind anyone is in possession of. Of all the people to dream about, I dreamt about... her.",27
"Think about this. Concentrate hard. Turn down your music and focus on my words. I can't ask you to close your eyes because that's just stupid and you won't be able to read the words.  Anyhow.  Imagine for a moment that the room you're in suddenly changed. A light mist came across you and you couldn't even see your fingers. This mist comes in gradually, slowly thickening in texture till as afore mentioned, visibility is at zero.  Then the mist clears.  And it reveals the walls, no longer are you in your elaborately designed and comfortable room but you're sitting in a cube. The walls, looking like they are made of a plate of metal and discoloured slightly, are far enough for you to move around but close enough that you begin to feel nauseas and slightly claustrophobic. A familiar knot, associated with fear, starts to twist in your stomach and you wonder where this is all leading.  But you already know.  The walls start to move in on you, the room starts to lose its dimensions and for a split second, you wonder how it is possible for the walls to shrink in from all directions at the same time. You both marvel at the ingenuity of the rooms creator and how its intelligence will lead to your ultimate death.  But centimetres away from reducing you into a paper-thin wafer of yourself, the walls stop moving. And you're compressed although not to the point where your life has been squeezed from your flesh and blood. You cannot move. Breathing, while possible is difficult. Your jaw does not have enough space to move. You panic and your mind starts to race as it both looks for a way out and resigns itself to its fate. You feel queasy as your sympathetic nervous system causes your body to rise to a fight-flight response, releasing all manners of enzymes in your body and causing your muscles to become stronger but due to their inability to move, the lactic acid buildup gives you cramps. You become desperate and not only does your mind works to try to escape, it also runs through scenarios in your life. The worst memories and the best ones. And you wonder if you will ever see the light of day again.  Throughout it all. You cannot. Move.  And then someone tells you to smile. How do you feel? Like I do?",27
"This is how bored and sad I am. 1.30 in the morning on a Friday night and instead of being out or doing my thing, I’m home watching Kill Bill Vol. 2. Again. This time, I watched the whole film and interestingly enough, I discovered a few interesting things while watching the credits.  Michael Parks plays both Sheriff McGraw in one of the initial scenes in Volume 1 and Senor Esteban in Volume 2. I mean, I don’t know about you, but he wouldn’t be considered a famous actor but he’s pretty good, managing to pull off a redneck Texas accent flawlessly as McGraw and then goes on to play a perfect Mexican pimp. Exactly as you’d expect it from the stereotypes you get. Interesting what make up could do and cover up I guess.   Gordon Liu plays both Johnny Mo, the head of the Crazy 88 in Volume 1, and then again as Pai Mei, the kick ass kung fu God in Volume 2. From a distinct lack of hair to an excess of it.   Even lesser known would be Samuel L. Jackson, who from having a major part in Pulp Fiction, goes to being Rufus, the piano player in Volume 2. Still, he and Uma Thurman would probably be the only big names in the movie itself, including both volumes, except for maybe Chiaki Kuriyama, the plastic-faced Japanese actor who plays Gogo Yubari, the psychotic school girl. But she’s only big in Japan. I think.   Pretty sad how I watch so much horseshit nowadays. Not that it’s a bad movie, just that… it’s an excess of it. Same with TV; every night, without fail, I’d watch The Simpsons [Channel 10, 6-6.30pm]. It’s like a damned ritual for me, one which I carry out daily. I don’t think I’ve missed an episode yet, except for Mondays, where I’ve got English tutoring.    I need a life.",27
"I had the distinct pleasure of watching 4 movies the other night; courtesy of a school friend who was nice enough to burn them onto CD for me. Anyway, I figured I’d share my mind on them, like it or not.    Kill Bill Vol. 2  God this is a cool movie. Much like any other Tarantino film, the movie is broken up into chapters and then twisted into one incredible film. We see the past of The Bride [a.k.a. Beatrix Kiddo for those chumps out there who didn’t know] and obviously, how she deals with the remaining nemesis’s out there.   Still, although lacking the  quantity  of bloodshed of the first, it makes up for it with the  quality  of death in the second. Bud gets a snake bite in the face, Elle Driver gets her eye ripped out and Bill, as could be foreseen, gets hit by the Five Point Palm exploding technique. Some tricky shit that Pai Mei taught Beatrix. It’s a bit of an anti-climax, but I guess it’d be pointless having them cross Hanzo swords before someone gets a limb sliced off.    A person like Pai Mei who from information leaked in the movie, could possibly be immortal, is considered a pugilist with an unholy proficiency in martial arts and has wisdom far greater than any other being on this Earth. This man is killed by a hot headed Caucasian female under his tutelage. Not only that, he is killed by underhanded means and not an outright battle. That much I can understand. What gets me thinking though, is that if I were Pai Mei, and I’m neither as smart nor as powerful, I’d sure as hell make sure I have the ability to purge poison from my body. If I could kill a person by merely tapping him on his body with my fingertips, wouldn’t I have some all-neutralizing antidote? But okay, I guess for the sake of the movie, we’ll let that little worm of a treacherous bitch kill the coolest character in the movie.    Pulp Fiction  Watching these two in a row, I got a taste of Tarantino overload. Still, it’s good to watch the man at work, he sure makes a mean movie. Coupled with a A-list team of celebrities and we have ourselves a blockbuster. Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman [I wonder. Does Tarantino have something for her… She’s pretty fine looking in Kill Bill, but not so much here], John Travolta [check out the ponytail] and Samuel L. Jackson.  However, at some parts of the movie, I feel I must question Tarantino’s… taste. Oh sure, it’s a subjective thing and all but is it  really  necessary to see a big, black, bald man getting anal raped by another man? For god’s sake. After watching that, I damn well nearly had to get my eyes cleaned out with paint thinner.    Pirates of the Caribbean  Ah. This particular one had girls all over swooning over the two main characters. Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom. Speaking as a male and I concede that I might be mistaken, I think Orlando Bloom looked better in LOTR. Johnny Depp definitely steals the limelight from Orlando Bloom as the incredibly charismatic and sneaky pirate, Captain Jack Sparrow.   No complaints with this movie though, nothing I could particularly nitpick on. Oh wait. There is. Jack Sparrow occasionally acts like a pansy. Getting slapped by a woman is a painful ordeal [although I’ve never known truth be told. I cover my tracks well] but I doubt a swashbuckling corsair who lays the smack down on a cursed crew of pirates would run and walk like he puts foundation on at home.    Donnie Darko  Now this one… First though at the start of the movie: “What the fuck?”. Last thought at the end of the movie: “What the fuck?” The movie doesn’t help clarify anything and I have no inkling of how the movie managed to make it into the top 100 [imdb.com].   Definitely lots to pick on this one. I don’t know about you, but if I were to travel through time, I wouldn’t pick a gigantic demonic bunny suit to travel with. I’d pick something like… Luke Skywalker’s robes or a Darth Maul costume instead of a satanic looking soft toy. Even then.   I didn’t get this one, but you could blame it on my stupidity instead of the movie’s fault I guess. I’ll make it a point to rewatch this one. After doing something less painful. Like sticking my dick into an oven on high heat.",27
"People keep asking me what I want to do in university. The answer to this is really quite clichéd, seeing as I’d like to do Law, however unrealistic, in university. It’s especially important with my parents, both of the typical Asian breed and believing completely in paper qualifications and that your education is of vital importance such that one without lives a condemned life. This sure as hell isn’t true, seeing as more than a few people have made it in a big way in life without even having completed high school. So much for your PhD dad.  Maybe I should elaborate; with my life, no matter how boring and monotonous, I’d like to do something with it. I figure that everyone’s got a talent somewhere, no matter what in. Of course, there are those with talents in nothing useful, but I suppose some would regard it a talent nonetheless. I personally don’t know what talents I possess. I’m still trying to figure that one out. Or at least, the good characteristics so I know which ones to hone on in. I’ll tell you what though? I’m particularly good at the art of horseshit. Which really, is a pathetic thing to be talented in, although it might come in handy getting yourself out of trouble.  Since I was young, I’ve always entertained the idea of having my own store. I never quite figured out what I wanted to do with the store but at different parts of my life, various ideas came to mind. Oh sure, there’s been the café phase, the toy store, even the LAN gaming centre. Nothing that particularly sticks out I guess, except for maybe the florist. But that’s another tale for another day.   However, with all those hare brained ideas, I never ever filled a niche. I would be one of many and knowing myself rather well, I know I would be unhappy at the prospect of not being a little, beautiful and unique snowflake. Man I’m sarcastic.   Anyhow, it was a few weeks ago when I stumbled upon the beginnings of an idea which I’ve given some thought to. See, I love clothes shopping but a major problem with that is that you’ve got to walk around and spend your money at different places; which is fine, unless you happen to own the store and quite naturally, you’d like everyone to spend their money at yours. But what would set apart my store from the rest?  First and foremost, it would be a basic store selling street clothes. By that, I mean the clothes that I wear. Kinda like… my style, but me selling it instead of buying. For the less informed among you, this would mean brands like XLARGE, Stussy, Zoo York, Freshjive, etc etc. Ah, but there are plenty of stores like that, Mooks for example, retails all that and what would set me apart from that? Apart from the fact that I’d like my store to stock shoes as well, excessive amounts, mind you, like half Hype DC and the other half Mooks. Not only that, music CD’s would be on sale, along with headphones, turntables and other instruments that a budding musician would need.   But what would be the audience I cater to? I figure, right about now, with this particular idea, I’m targeting youths aged 16 – late 20’s. Or those particularly young at heart at any rate. However, the catered group would be a stratified one. They would be the clubbers and not the pub-bers, if you get that. You’re definitely not going to be able to get Shania Twain whereas you’d be able to find more underground hip-hop stuff. Like all the DJ Shadow records. On 12”.  Fundamentally, the store would cater to me. Or that’s the bottom line anyway. Pretty fucking small target group ey? But this is a youth superstore. It sells most things a youth would need seeing as we can’t really spend our money at much else anyway [besides alcohol and tobacco], so we spend it on clothes, drugs, alcohol, CD’s, a car and other wasteful instruments of entertainment. The store would stock most things our mischievous generation would want without crossing the legal lines.  But here’s where I fill the niche. Many a time, I’ve gone to a shop and requested for a specific T-shirt. I’m the type of person who knows what I want before I go into the store and I’ve got a rather one-tracked mind. See, I’m not going to say that my store would have literally, everything. I understand and sympathize that my stocks are not complete and I will lack in some things. Here’s where I differ from other stores.   While another retail store might say “Hey look, we don’t stock it, sorry, we’ll be getting fresh stock in a month’s time, come back then” and leave you thinking “Thanks a lot. Thanks for nothing.” I would, tell you “Sorry, but we don’t stock it right now, if you’d like I could order it for you. That particular T-shirt.” How good would that be? Imagine wanting say, Air Force One’s (Ltd. Edt. Year of the Monkey’s), and going to a store which doesn’t have it. Which is fine. But imagine if they could get it for you if you’d wait for about two weeks or so. Same with the music CD’s [but they’ve got to be good. Don’t come in requesting fucking Backstreet Boys unless you want a Louisville slugger on the side of your head].   Not only that, the employees would be a tad different to other places. See, I don’t pride myself on being good-looking, I admit, I couldn’t begin to compare to say Orlando Bloom or whoever the fuck you pick. But herein lie the perks of being the boss. I get to pick the employees. Call me discriminatory, but I’d like to hire employees who carry the clothes well. For example, going into Mooks today, I saw what a yuppie would term a metrosexual. In other words, a pussy boy. See, no fucking way would I hire something like that. Girls are meant to be beautiful, tall, lithe and sexy creatures that put lipstick on. Males, at their epitome of physical perfection are not meant to carry make-up kits around and wear G-strings. I’m sorry. Sue me.   It’s still an idea. I think it could work, but the basic problem would be getting it off the ground. I’ll need a bit of capital for doing that and I know my parents sure as hell aren’t going to give it to me. Maybe one day… Oh of course, the delusions of grandeur are present and I fantasize about going global seeing as I don’t think anyone’s really done this before. Or at least not that I know of, which could be due to sheer ignorance.   And then there’s the idea about the club. That one… I’d like to do. But probably after the store. We’ll see.",27
"All of us look for different things when we search for a potential member of the opposite sex. Some of us dig materialistic things, wanting tangible output out of the relationship. These include those girls and boys who date the rich kids, hoping to get a new Louis Vuitton bag out of it, or just excessive pampering. Others look for that someone special to be with, and these are the ones known as the sincere, loving ones. But for whatever the reason, we all look for specific things in the opposite sex.   Honestly, I acknowledge that looks do matter and that physical attraction is always a strong starter for a relationship. It’s what sparks your interest in the potential significant other in the first place. I’m tempted to say that I put looks over all else, but someone here would fuck me up for that, so I’m not going to. All I’ll say however is that taste is subjective. So there.   Still, don’t you ever realise that… for some incomprehensible reason, the person you feel for is always the most beautiful person on earth? I can’t even begin to understand it, and I sure as hell can’t explain it, but I think that all of you know what I’m talking about. Sometimes, a person appears only moderately attractive or perhaps even slightly unattractive to you. But after you start to fall in love… your perception changes. All of a sudden, she’s the most gorgeous woman that ever existed. You could actually say those words without lying, honestly meaning it with every fibre of your being and genuinely adoring her. Against overwhelming odds, you might beg to differ when someone calls her average looking or perhaps, God forbid, ugly. You would argue for her, trying in futility to convince everyone that even Aphrodite herself could not hold a candle to your beloved.  Personally, the thing which has always attracted me to a woman would be her eyes and smile. Clichéd but true nonetheless. I’ve never understood why someone’s eyes could move so little, but yet tell you so much. I personally reckon it’s all in the eyes. Oh sure, the face plays a big part in it, but her eyes would certainly be the major focus of it all. Lying in bed with your sweetheart, looking her in the eye, for some reason, you just know how she feels. It’s at that time where I start to feel fuzzy and warm all over, where heart-shaped fireworks explode in my heart and truly, eternity would not be enough time for me to tell her how much I love her. Her eyes might come in any number of shapes, for Asians, they’re typically long narrow slits, with perhaps a slight hump in the middle, tinged with brown, but Oriental nonetheless. Your archetypal Anglo-Saxon female would have blue eyes and long girly lashes whereas a female of Negroid descent might have circular eyes, short eyelashes with a touch of ruggedness behind them.   If her eyes were to be rubies inset into a face of platinum, her lips would definitely be parallel rows of diamond. These are, to me at any rate, the star attraction of any female’s countenance. If she were to be upset or depressed, successfully performing the feat of rescuing her unhappy soul from the abyss of dejection would fill me with more joy than this page could hold. A girl’s smile, for whatever reason, is always a beautiful thing. Even if she were to be considered not-as-attractive-to-others, a smile on her would cause a glow to radiate from her similar to the manner in which the Sun spreads its warmth on this wretched planet of ours. Imagine then, if your precious smiled at you. How beautiful would she look?   God. I’m going mushy in my insanity. Still, I’m entitled to dream in my singlehood no?",27
"Living in Melbourne’s a great thing. It’s a nice city, livable and where the weather ain’t half bad all year round. I could go on and on about why I love this city but I think you get the general idea. Most importantly, some of the women here are pretty damn hot. Going to clubs, or Asian clubs anyway, you observe a stratified sample of the population of Asian women around. Don’t get me wrong, not every single one of them are beautiful [although one can wish…] but in general, they’re generally in possession of a pretty face, or at least a curvaceous body.   One thing confuses me though. Why is it you never get hot neighbours? I don’t know about you, but I’ve never ever lived anywhere close [and by this I mean on the same street] as a beautiful female around my age. Oh sure there’ve been instances when I was younger [like the time I was living next to Fann Wong, the girl in Shanghai Knights]. But hey, I was 11 and she was in her mid 20’s. Good luck with that.  Anyhow, over the last 2 years, for all the houses I lived in, I’ve never had the fortune to reside next to a hot blooded female who looked semi decent. The female who best suits my… criteria living close to me drives a P-plated car, which lets me think she’s within the age range of 18-21. But she’s so… unattractive that the mere sight of her ruins any chance I have of getting a boner over the next 50 years.   So, in a moment of sheer boredom and curiosity, this afternoon I did some calculations on my own. You sure didn’t think probability would come in handy eh? I figured it a little something like this. Melbourne has a population of around 4.3 million people and half of them would be females right? As we all know, the probability of a girl being at least moderately good looking on a scale of 10 would mean that she is at least a 5. Statistically, it’s about Pr(Looks≥ 5) = 9/30. [You’ll never believe where I got it from] Which gives a nice number of 0.3.   If you ask me, that’s a pretty good probability rate. But that’s a stratified sample and if only a third of all girls were at least decent looking. If only. But for simplicity’s sake, I’m more than willing to use it.   But the buck doesn’t stop there. There has to be a predefined range of ages right? Seeing as I’m 16, and I’ve never been with a younger girl, I’m going to make an exception here. I’m taking all females aged 14-20. Shut up. Not a word. I know 14’s young. And that 20’s old. But I’m being generous here. Again, statistically, this gives me about a fifth of the population. Pr(14 ≤ Age ≤ 20) = 0.05. It’s a pretty small number, I know, but Melbourne’s got an aging population so I figured it for around there.   Okay, so if a girl were to be both hot and within the age range, the probability of that would be 0.015. Which is about 1.5%. Now I don’t know about you, but I think that’s a pretty accurate number. God. That’s fucking sad. Still, it’s a fact of life and we’ve got to move on.   Even then, forgiving all of that, as I mentioned before, using that number, there would be about 32,250 fine looking women in that age range. So where’d they all go?  That’s a fair amount of pretty ladies, more than enough for having two a day for the next 44 years. But as I said, where’d they all go? Okay, assuming there are 2.5 people to a house [on average], there would be about 1,720,000 houses in Melbourne. Which is again, about right. So that 32,250 divided by 1,720,000 gives me a figure of 0.01875. Plugging the numbers into my calculator, that means for about every 50 houses, give or take 4 houses, there should be a beautiful woman my age.   Now that’s a fucking fantastic thing seeing as I live in Hawthorn and houses are densely packed together. Heck, there’re probably 100 houses on my street alone. This brings to my mind, the obvious question “Where is she?”  If anyone can answer that question, feel free to answer. I’m at a complete loss as to why my neighbourhood has a complete lack of fine women. If someone ever invents a HWSD [Hot Woman Seeking Device], I’m sure as hell going to be the first in line to buy it. I hate statistical anomalies.",27

"Time for a light hearted post. The past few have been pretty damn depressing so I figured I change the tone of this blog. Plus the fact that I’m in a good mood sure helps.  Just spoke to my father and after consultation with my mother, we came to a deal for my future car. Oh sure, I realise that I’m only 16 and I can’t drive by myself till I hit 18 [which happens to be in a year and half time but oh well].   If all goes well [and by that, no fucking around, good behaviour on my part not to mention a kick ass VCE score], I’ll end up driving a spanking new Lexus IS200. Or IS300 if I’m lucky. Extra lucky, but hey, an IS200 would suit my needs just fine.   Of course, this sparks dreams of what I’m going to do with the car and I think the first thing I’d probably do [apart from putting in a new CD/MP3 player unit plus new speakers] would be to get a personalised license plate. Research shows that it’d cost me around 300 dollars. Which… is a substantial amount of money for a metal plate but it’s not like I have a choice.   Frankly, I’d like to put in PIMPIN. After the song P.I.M.P., but I know I’ll get endless amounts of shit for it seeing as not many females would be riding in my car. Still, it bears nice thoughts. LUVVYA would be less ostentatious but it’s more of a girl thing.  The license plate being the second thing people look at when you drive up [the first being the car itself and the third being the driver. “Is he hot?”], I need something with neutral connotations. I definitely need more than 6 characters but seeing as Victoria [I hate that name] won’t allow me to put in more than that, I’ll have to compromise.  So, I think I’ll settle on something like JAYTAN or something to that effect. Enough to proclaim that it’s my car and yet, not flamboyant [although putting in a personal license plate is pretty flashy in itself]. Ah, I’ll figure something out later.   *Dreamy sigh*. And now, Chris is thinking to himself “Jono… Always ‘what’ but never ‘how.” Ah, but this time is different. I’ve figured How I’m going to do it already. Good behaviour shouldn’t be too difficult and the only thing that worries me would be the excessive amounts I’ll be going out and the omnipresent risk of being busted smoking. Again. I’ll have to take extra precautions with that of course, and I’ve already had a number of ideas of how I’m going to conceal it. Smelling salts in the car, packets of tobacco taped under tables and copious amounts of deodorant.   It’s all good.",27
"The teen movie that started it all. This movie will live on forever in history as succeeding generations of teenagers carry on the traditions taught to us in this film. I wonder how teenagers in future would look at it. I mean, sure, parties sure as hell aren’t filled with truckloads of beautiful babes. In fact, more often than not, we’d be lucky to get 10% of the girls actually decent looking. Then again, who am I to talk. I’m no Adonis myself.  Anyhow, as most of you can tell, I just finished watching Part 2 of the trilogy. Almost like Lord of The Rings, but perhaps making a bigger impact on us because we relate it to it better than a Halfling trying to throw a gold ring into molten lava.   Personally, the second instalment was my favourite one. I used to dream that the high school friends I’ve made would be like that. An unbreakable cabal brought together by circumstance and united by friendship. Perhaps, if not for some of the mistakes I’ve made [I think of one particular one, which was a mistake in more than that one way] it would have been a realistic dream.   I remember, fondly, of times spent discussing after school plans. I remember one in particular, that we, as a bunch, would drive down to a friend’s beach house in Sorrento. Alcohol would flow in abundance, cigarette packs would be stacked chest high and seeing as we were all single back then, we thought things would remain the same. Complete freedom from the shackles of love and perhaps we might’ve brought a few of our lady friends along. Chances are that we wouldn’t have, but it was a nice thought to bring them along. I still remember, vividly, that I said I’d be Santa Porn for awhile and be in charge of bringing the ah… adult entertainment. No names of course, but someone was to drive and someone else was to bring the beach volleyball. We could all foresee great and memorable times ahead of us. Drunkenness and lecherous behaviour would rule the day, immorality would reign supreme, but in the end… it would be a time we would never forget.   Now, I wonder how many of us remember that dream. When we look back on in 10 years time, what memories would we have? I made the mistake [one of many, I assure you] of not taking any pictures of the times I spent with my friends. I have nothing to remember my high school times by. Half of the year has already elapsed and yet… all I remember of this year, or the outstanding bits are times of heartbreak, disappointment and frustration. It’s sad how it turned out this way. I guess, back then, not even a year ago, I was young and childish in dreaming that friendships last forever.   Even now, I feel the onset of tears in my eyes. Something which I haven’t had in a long time. Even lost love wasn’t able to bring this about but this… empty promises and broken dreams. I feel pangs of regret, things I should have done and things I should not have done.   As you read this, friendships are broken in school. Past graduating years of Scotch Collegians had a group of Asians, seeing as we segregate ourselves automatically according to race, and most of them are friends, albeit not as close, even today. I wonder though, after the year is over, how many of the people would I call? How many would call me?   The very thought of this saddens me. What was once a group of young men wanting to have good times, wanting to remain friends forever. I don’t see that anymore. I see a group of immature bitches who have more interest in schoolboy politics than anything else. I accept that people bitch, but is this really necessary? Again, I have reservations on how many people see this.  The group is fractured, split and turned against one another. Not many have nice words to say about each other and the other who has left the Asian clique of friends has seen it as well. Sad to say, he couldn’t care less what happened. I guess, I care more seeing as my skin remains the same colour as them, but I find it disappointing that we could be like this. Each of the individual people I’ve had the misfortune to speak to have realised this. No one trusts one another anymore.   Just think, wouldn’t it be nice, if we were all friends again. Ready to stand for each other and where for once, harmony would reign. I accept that there would be differences between people, but perhaps not as much as we do now. Wouldn’t it be fantastic if we could say “He is my friend” without having a shadow of doubt over those words? Just those simple words and people find it hard enough to say. How great would it be if we could say “Friends Forever” and know that there’s an honest chance of it coming true. That we would all remain friends forever, that we would never lose touch and we would never separate.   It’s pathetic really. But alas, what can be done? People place too much stress on their self pride nowadays, unwilling to make up and to say “sorry”. I know I do. Plus, the fact that we’re all in the final year of school, while making this all the more important, ensures that we don’t have the time to do anything about it. The already strained bonds of friendship we took so long to forge throughout the years have already snapped.   We’ll all move on, we won’t slow down. We’ll make new friends and we’ll all go on with our lives. We accept things as they come and as our lives change. But… when we look back, one, two, three, maybe even six decades from now, would we regret this? I know I would. My memory might fail me in my later years, but for the time being… I know they won’t fade. But what memories do I have of this year?",27
"All of us have taken part in charities every now and then, most of us playing the part of donors, but I guess when we feel particularly generous, or are forced to by the school, we become unwilling volunteers and go out there to collect money for the children of some forgotten land.   But I wonder, what’s the real point of charity? You think the $20 you give to the Red Cross every year is going to help the poor starving masses of Africa when countries like America dump thousands of tonnes of grain into their rivers to ensure fucking Farmer Bob in Kansas can afford to have an extra fireplace in his 30,000 hectare ranch? Or when bitching farmers in Australia get paid extra to produce less meat so that the CEO’s of Coles can buy a brand new Mercedes SL500? Good one.   The world’s definitely going the right way isn’t it? Oh sure, I’m quite guilty of those charges. I do chuck my half finished piece of steak away into the bin because I’m a vain fudgepacking bastard and wish to become slim. I do buy two chocolate croissants when one would suffice for no other reason than the fact that they’re fucking tasty. I pay a good amount of money more for clothes which I think look good rather than clothes which meet my necessity. Not to mention leaving my lights and stereo on because I like the atmosphere they provide although I don’t pay attention to the music and I’m not in my room.   I’m guilty of all that. So sue me. The mere fact that you’re reading this means you’re almost exactly like me. You’re using the internet, an extravagance according to most people in this forsaken world of ours. Chances are you’ll be using the phone later, automatically putting you in the top 10% of the world’s population seeing as 50% have never made a phone call. It’s really quite pathetic isn’t it?   Here’s some more. I’m proud to say I’ve never known neither hardship nor starvation. I bitch and complain about having restrictions sure, but I’ve never had to go hunt my next meal. I’m proud to say I have someone washing my clothes for me and don’t have to support 10 starving mouths. I’m especially proud to say I can take a Panadol pill when I’ve got a slight migraine in the morning and have never had a flesh eating bacteria slowly consuming my arm.   I’m fortunate and so are you. Appreciate it. Help those masses out there who aren’t as fortunate as we are. Come to think of it, most of you are in private school. I can think of one exception [or two actually. You know who you are] but one of you gets, or used to get, more money in a month than most people earn in six. We’re very fortunate people here. So go help those who really need our help.   How do we go about doing this? Frankly, I’m not sure if the money you donate to charity is any help. For some reason, of all the millions that have been given over the years, I don’t think anything’s changed in the country. Of course, this could be through sheer ignorance, but I have it on source from a person who went on a mission trip to Faridabad, India, that over 6 million dollars had been put into that little shanty town. And not one single fucking school. Not to mention the food packages given to the villages of savannah Africa. I still don’t hear any news of them. But maybe that’s just me.   I say we pressure the leading world nations of the world into doing something about it. If we spent half the amount of money we do on fucking thermonuclear warheads on helping the needy, we might get somewhere. Isn’t that wonderful? We’re killing two birds with one stone. First off, we reduce the amount of weapons in the world and create and oh-so-wonderful utopian paradise for all of us. Plus, the chance of us wearing fallout masks and radiation suits out to the front yard would be significantly reduced. Also, we get to improve the welfare of the needy people in Mongolia or some other God-forsaken third world backwater country.   Man. I should be president.   Thank you for your time.",27
"In one of my complete-strike-at-random sullen moods and how do I deal with it? Express how I feel by writing on a site which as many people as I have fingers have the URL to. God I’m sad. Anyhow, reading through another Jonathan Kellerman novel [my third one], something mentioned by one of the characters struck me.  Well, two things, both of which were loosely linked to each other. One was misanthropy; the concept of. Wait. Maybe I better define misanthropy first. Reading through the dictionary, it’s defined as “hatred or distrust for mankind”. Maybe we all feel like that sometimes, just world weary and cynical. I know I do. Anyway, there were two chief schools of thought. One by Swift and the other by Pope. One hated mankind as a general structural unit but yet managed to like individuals. The other was the reverse, disliking each link of the chain although incomprehensibly able to love the chain as a whole.   One of the more famous and more… pro active misanthropists was a fellow known as Carl Panzram. Now, Carl over here just hated mankind and was one of the most well known serial killers of all time. I say was because of the sheer fact that we know his name, he was hanged, his last words to the world a big “Fuck you”. Carl was a brilliant person and was one of the more genuinely hard-done-by-society-and-has-a-real-reason-to-take-revenge kinda person. But this isn’t about him. I’ve introduced him and I’ll be using him later, just be patient.   The next thing that raised questions in my mind were the concept of Limits. Not limits in the sense of the word of “I can’t jump 2 meters like Jordan can” or “I’ve only got an IQ of 140”. It’s more the limits of right and wrong. Your conscience. Let’s skip the peashooters and bring out the big guns. Murder. What we perceive as the most severe of all crimes. For example, all of us [or those who shower anyway] kill millions of organisms every single time we step into the shower. Although insignificant, a bacterium still possesses Life. Others still, have no qualms about killing ants, bugs, spiders, maybe even snakes. Ah, then when it comes to larger animals like birds or cats or dogs, the buck stops there for most females. Moving on, some people slaughter cows, pigs, goats and chickens for a living. Larger life forms and therefore considered more repulsive. Of course you get fisherman who kill dolphins and hunters who shoot elk and the list goes on. However, what distinguishes these life forms? Are they not all life? For whatever subjective limits we impose on ourselves, like “No killing things with a vertebrae” or “Don’t kill cute animals”, we all have our limits when it comes to Death. I think I’d be safe in saying that all of us would not kill for the sheer sake of killing. But what divides a human from a dolphin? Or an ant? Hitler [most psychologists classified the man as a psychopath] revelled in the killing of Jews and homosexuals but cringed at the sight of someone kicking a dog. This seeming reversal of values is considered revolting because we, the vain homo sapiens believe ourselves to be superior to all other life forms on Earth. As such, we learn from a young age that the slaughter of another human is unforgivable and perhaps that’s why it’s considered the worst crime someone can commit [Except in America, where smoking marijuana gets you a harsher sentence than murder. But hey, it’s America]. Of course, there are punishments worse than death, but we can’t really compare seeing as those who are dead can’t talk anymore.   And here’s where Mr Panzram comes in. He had no limits or distinguishing factors, believing that the taking of a human life was insignificant and seeing as he was the one who actually committed the act with a knife or whichever murderous utensil he happened to have and not from a vintage oak desk on the phone to Himmler, I suspect Panzram would have been more of a psychopath than Hitler, only that he lacked the means to be on such a grand scale of state sponsored murder.   Imagine now, with teenagers reading books stored in school libraries about these men and then having access to firearms as nations allow a mentally disturbed 18yr old to purchase a .50 Desert Eagle whereas prohibiting a 50yr old security guard who stole a candy bar as a kid [and let’s face it. Who hasn’t done something illegal] from purchasing a .22 hunting rifle for quail.   Who said the world was getting better? We actually have kids who look up to psychopaths as role models.  Heil Hitler.",27
"Spending my Friday night at home alone watching the MTV Movie Awards 2004, I’m naturally a bit bored. Between working out during the adverts and reducing my brain to rot with watching the shows, I couldn’t help but notice a certain advertisement   While others might not have noticed, me being the racist bigoted person I am, the new Toyota advertisement made an impression on me. Toyota, as the name sounds, is a Japanese company, or last I checked anyway. The funny thing was that it had Steve Irwin, who prides himself on being an Australian, as the star of the advert. I wonder if the executives over in Japan ever thought about that. Or Steve Irwin’s public relations manager. Supposing he had one, seeing as any PR manager, no wait, any reasonable person would have told him not to do the following.  I might not be entirely accurate with my facts so feel free to correct me, but if memory serves me right, Steve Irwin was almost awarded the Australian Of The Year award. However, the dolt, with a stupidity I find disturbing, dangled his toddler child over an enclosure filled with one of the two oldest, most ancient and most perfect predators in the world. The other being the shark, but that’s not the point.   So this dumb ass finds himself disqualified from that award but cuts a deal with a Japanese car company to appear on one of their adverts. I don’t know about you, but I guess coming from overseas, I’ve always looked at Steve Irwin as a representative of Australia, and for all his lack of brains and for having one of the most annoying accents in the world, would have been an ideal model for Australia. I don’t follow. Oh shouldn’t he be on a Holden advert you say? Well, Holden’s actually owned by GMC [General Motors Company], an American company. Then again, it’s not the only “Aussie” company owned by an overseas corporate.   However, no I’m not all bitter. In all, the MTV Movie Awards was very entertaining, certainly a highlight for TV this year. Definitely worth staying at home for; oh go on laugh. I know I didn’t have a choice.",27
"Being in the final year of school can be stressful and I think the one thing which most of us lack [or want more of at any rate] would be motivation. You hear it all the time ""Oh damn, I'm so unmotivated"", ""Shit, I need to study harder but I can't be fucked"". Yeah you know the usual slew of phrases you hear so often from frustrated school kids.  Anyhow, me being the curious person that I am, I wondered where motivation was derived from and here are some of my thoughts. Many of my contemparies [myself included] work due to incentive. Some are promised a car, others cash bonuses and what have you. Generally, they are objects of great value to the person and hence is traded for good results. Usually, these gifts are material and have great tangible value. However, this brings images to mind of a donkey walking to get a carrot. And I know who's the donkey.  Others work for a sense of satisfaction, and with the Incentive scheme, earning that reward gives you that sense of satisfaction, where you're happy and feel pleased with yourself. There are those who work for intangible things, and by work, I don't always mean academically, and try to get them. The intangibles might include say, a sense of self worth or one of those fuzzy feelings we get from doing a good deed.   Like now, it's about 1.30 in the morning and I've got school tomorrow and I'm up chatting to this lady, who happens to be a rather beautiful one, which probably explains my sudden determination to stay up and to keep typing away.   Motivation or foolishness. Sheesh.",27

After the race, we shall endeavour to punctuate our sojourn through life with fine food, camaraderie and women. Lots of women!

"It has now been 87 days since I’ve been declared single. Those of you who have the URL to this site would know well enough of my previous state. I’m glad to say however, that I believe, rightly or wrongly, that all trace of that has been wiped. Memories remain, some here to stay while others fade with time, but I believe, given enough time, all will recede.   What I will say however, is that the lack of makes you desire more. Like when two lovebirds have been separated, the time spent in anticipation only heightens the actual experience of being together. I guess it’s intriguing, but only to be expected out of two people going through a chaotic swirl of raging emotions. And hormones for those who are more… physical – pleasure inclined.   Absence makes the heart grow fonder. Oh yes it does.",27
"I’m home alone and fucking bored. What do I do? I read. And then I write on what I read.  The purpose of this entry however, is not to explain my current condition, it’s much too trivial a thing to write about. However, reading a novel, and quite an excellent one at that [wouldn’t you know it. I have the dandiest luck, picking a romance novel randomly] caused me to wonder about the coming about of human emotions.  For example, I wonder about the genesis of our emotions. Would it be the fact that we think and therefore we feel that enables us to experience underlying and tender emotions for others? While some of us might hypothesize that it also enables the strong and raw feelings of hatred, we view violence in the savage and untamed animal world all the time. Whether that violence is brought about by instinct or bad behaviour by the animal is another matter. [I’d use evil, but I’ve mentioned before that it’s a very theologically burdening word and who’s to say that animals have a grasp of the simple and naïve views we have on good and evil].  We see this all the time, people in love, people who hate, people who are indifferent and even those who are on some level, in the range of the spectrum but on neither extreme. I think this would have been the first time I actually ceased and questioned myself “Why do we do the things we do?”. Psychologists believe it is a cocktail of nature and nurture; people are the way they are because of their genes and environment. Let me elaborate, a child born to a violent father, drunken mother and exposed to a torturous cycle of abuse and neglect would quite naturally, have different views to the world as opposed to your typical blond haired, blue eyed angel, brought up with two loving parents who are your stereotyped pay-our-taxes-and-Ned-Flanders-is-our-role-model pair of parents who gave all they could to her. In my analogy, I shall use “Him” as the miscreant and “Her” as the perfect child; a tribute to the fairer gender. =)   Would He have resulted the way he did if he were to be in Her environment? One might even surmise that it would be due to his testosterone, the stupidity-inducing male hormone that caused him to behave the way he does. The world reels in shock when a six-year old Him spits venom and talks of crucifixion but sighs in softness when a six-year old Her plays with her toy ponies.   But if we proceeded to place Him in Her environment and vice versa, would the results have been any different? Or would there be a compromise of the two? It is a known fact, that males tend to be much like their fathers, or so they claim. I beg to differ, being so different from my father myself… However, such is not the subject of discussion and I beg your pardon for my divergence. The point I’m trying to make, or rather the question I’d like to ask is “Why are we who we are?” It’s of course, exceptionally difficult to find out when we accept that no two people are the same and could turn out completely different. We hear of extraordinary people all the time, those who are in the worst of circumstances and yet manage to succeed where others in far more fortunate positions have failed.   To be continued when I can be bothered.",27
"I arrived back in Melbourne early Wednesday morning, at about 4am and here I am back. Went to Mt. Buller yesterday for a spot of skiing and snow fun and well… It’s interesting, playing in the snow, fun and yet intriguing at the same time. For all I know, it could’ve been [God forbid] someone’s condensed piss falling down in a popsicle and me playing with it as if it were pure.  Anyhow, as a result of the biting cold yesterday, my lips are chapped to fuck. Dry, cracking and generally unpleasant, both to behold and to be in possession of. Ah well, these physical ailments will go away but soon.  Of late however, something’s been bugging me more so than the other things. Not only are the VCE examinations a mere 3 and a half months away [OH MY FUCKING GOD!] but I haven’t been as hardworking as I should be. But alas, that’s not the main thing on my mind.   Interestingly [or to me at any rate], I’m dreaming far more than I usually do. I mean, it’s scientifically proven that we dream twice a night [we don’t always remember our dreams which explains why you might or might not know about that] but I find myself dreaming about 4 to 8 times a night, always about completely unrelated things. Some trivial, some weird and some just plain fucked.   For example, last night, I dreamt I was a champion, award winning snowboarder. Which I can understand how it came about, seeing as I went to the snow in the day and since snowboarding is so fucking cool. Or I think so anyway, sliding down a slope on little more than a fancy designed and aeronautically optimal piece of fibreglass or wood. After that, I mentally travelled back to Singapore, to be with someone whose name I can’t even remember. As in, I was spending a whole day with her [hey, you didn’t think I’d dream of a him now would you]. I woke up from that one, needing to take a midnight slash [First thoughts: What the fuck!?]. I gave it no more thought, proceeding to fall back into Dreamland again. Next dream was a little weirder. I was walking in a desert with the landscape looking like it was designed by Tolkien, the author of Lord of the Rings. Unfortunately, it wasn’t the beautiful city and architecture of fucking Helm’s Peak or the elfish city, but more the drab and satanic landscape of Mordor. When someone like me, who detests Lord of the Rings starts dreaming about it, you know something’s wrong.   The next dream, I don’t want to talk about. That one was just plain wack and I can’t even begin to describe it. Well, I can, but I choose not to. I claim ineloquence. In fact. I don’t want to talk about the next 3. those, I’ll leave for myself. Keep in mind however, that the dreams didn’t appear in that order, I can’t remember the order in which I dreamt them [c’mon. It was in the wee hours of the morning and I didn’t give it much thought till I woke up]  Anyway. How’ve you been?",27

"Been a long time - you say you missed me Word gets round - you shouldn´t have dissed me Step back - don´t try to kiss me Right about now I´m 50/50  I heard it through the grapevine that you were with him Just the other night I dont know why I Try hard to keep you so happy when you don't love me Don't Love me   Are you calling me a liar? Are you saying that I´m not tellin the truth? Denying what she told me You know you got way too much to lose You're claiming they are rumours You say you got nothin else to hide How come she told me? She saw somebody by your side    *Sigh*. It's kinda cute seeing all your friends attached. Like today. Where there were 4 females and 5 males. Yup, you guessed who was odd one out. I mean, it wasn't awkard and the lovebirds weren't retreating into their own little world, everyone was talking and stuff. But it still got me thinking I guess. I figured I miss having someone there for me, someone whom I could really be myself around and to just give -her- a hug, one of those long embracing ones and release my pent-up emotions.  Then again. I never really did that with the one girlfriend I had or any of the other girls where there was something more than friends. I'd call it a fling, but that's generalizing and probably unfair on some of the girls seeing as in one or two of the cases, there actually were underlying feelings involved. Enough.  I remember having a crappy day at school or having a controversial issue in my life, after which I'd receive a message from -her- or -her- saying ""I miss you"" or ""I love you"". I reckon that always, without a doubt, made my day and caused a smile to appear on my face.   Then again. I don't even know what I want. I guess... It'll come when it does. Whatever it is. Whatever I'm looking for. Which at this point of time, would probably be material things. Like a new phone. And the San Antonio Spurs jersey I saw. And the Nike Dunk Hi's I saw. I won't even start with the car or the clothes.   I wish.",27
"Here's an example of how my school views me.  A few days before, I was discussing with a friend about the genesis of violence. Like whether it was nature or nurture, basically why people kill other people and assault and all those kind of actions. Not very nice things to do, but people do it anyhow. The debate then turned to a discussion of who among us students was most likely to commit violent acts and if so, how they would go about doing it.  The obvious weapon of choice [or for me at any rate] would be a weapon like a flick knife. A baseball bat, while useful, would be too conspicuous and hard to conceal, hardly the kind of thing you'd want to bring to school. A gun would be nice for its unrivalled killing power, but I can't touch one of those till I hit the big 1-8. Or at least not legally anyway. In any case, a gun would make too much noise unless I could lay my hands on a silencer. Not that I'd invest all that much money in ammunition anyway. And hollowpoint bullets, my ammunition of choice, is outlawed in most countries. Nunchakus are hard to use and require a degree of training to utilize proficiently. Okay, so we settled on flick knife.  So, unknowingly, I asked my tutor what would happen if a student were to bring a weapon to school. He then went on to ask ""What kind of weapon? Anything could be used as a weapon"". Fair enough, so I said ""A weapon like... a flick knife. Or butterfly. Something like that."" He then went on to talk about the legal proceedings and how the weapon itself was illegal in Australia anyway. Simple and expected.  The following day, I get called up and get my locker checked. Would you believe? They checked my locker for just asking about the consequences for bringing a knife to school. I don't know about you, but I don't think I'd be the type to bring a knife or any weapon for that matter, to school. It's too damn risky, plus, I really have no need to use weapons. I'd rather use my bare fists.  What bothers me is the principle behind the incident. I think I can safely say that if any other student were to ask an innocent question like that, nothing would have happened and the question would either be dismissed or answered. And that would be that.  But me? C'mon. I'm not a psychopathic and I sure as hell don't have a problem with violence. The last time I got into a fight was... okay fine. Two days ago, but the stupid fuck cut my hair. And all I did was just push him around. Oh sure, if you wanna get technical, there was last week, but the dumb shit wrecked my tie and my hair [which I took the trouble of doing in the morning] so he got what was coming to him. Thing is, the school didn't know about that and even if they did, I sure as hell wouldn't bring a knife to school.  Which raises the question, how does the school view me? Just a little analysis from this incident and shit, it's like the school perceives me exactly as I'm not. The world's gone crazy.",27
"Finally, some spare time to write a little something. I just got my VCE mid year exam results today and… needless to say I’m pretty fucking pissed at it. All those Saturdays spent studying my unfocused butt off, all those hours wasted and what do I have to show for it? A score worse than my biology paper last year which I know I could not have been less prepared for. So, if such were the case, and the less I study, the better I do, no wonder why I fucked up all my results for this semester.   I got dual B’s on both psychology and physics. For physics, I was kinda expecting a C or C+ maximum, so I guess I’m not too unhappy with that. However, psychology… this was a depressing mark. It irks me how for most of the year I had been going relatively well for this subject [through SAC results and all] and the end result is a big B.   What annoys me about this is that the other guy and I who had been going well throughout the year both did poorly in this paper. Maybe I shouldn’t have left the exam hall in 20 minutes huh? I knew I should’ve worked through all of it… Oh well. It’s over and there’s one more round of examinations to redeem myself and hopefully, just maybe, Law school is still a dream within my grasp. I don’t want it to be just that… just a dream.  Still, I think I shouldn’t have mucked around so much last term and instead prioritized my objectives. I sure as hell shouldn’t have focused on women so much, or clubbing, or socializing. Too many “ifs”. I’m just going to go out and do this thing.  New found motivation by the way; no longer shall I use a female as my incentive [they’re too damn unstable]. I’m going to use material goods. I’m a greedy motherfucker and I’m going to exploit this to the max of my ability. See, I admit I’m a bit of a spendthrift, rarely saving any money unless it’s a super special occasion [by that, I mean for someone whom I really really really really really really really really like. That’d be pretty much the only reason why I’d save up.] and I like to enjoy life by splurging and buying on impulse. However, my parents are not able to provide for me forever and sooner or later I’m going to have to leave this comfortable nest of mine and go out to earn my own money. Which really sucks. Not only that, I figure, we’ve got a set amount of hours in a day right? And in those hours, I need to get as much money as possible. Basically, I want maximum output with minimum input. Therefore, I need a high-paying job.   I thought of being a gigolo for awhile before the prospect of fucking the women who can’t get any [and think about how easy it is to get a male in bed. And then think about the fact that these women can’t get any. It really does say something doesn’t it? Oh sure, there was the whole moral, integrity thing, but that lasted a fleeting second]. That idea went down the drain, ne’er to be seen again, but not before ruining the likelihood of me cracking a boner for the next 50yrs or so.   Selling drugs would be a high paying gig too, but that breaks one of the rules that I have. Yes, I do adhere to a set of rules, albeit ones which I bend to my needs and whims. They’re probably more guidelines than rules, but anyhow… I couldn’t do it, knowing that I might be ruining the life of some kid somewhere and cause some family a lot of grief. I’ve already given my family enough grief, no need to give other families the sort of sadness mine has to deal with. I might, in future, just maybe, smoke a joint or two, but I doubt I’d ever get to the hard stuff [i.e. anything above marijuana. Which means ice, speedy, XTC, cocaine, heroin, you get the idea]. But that’s another thing.   But, that leaves the one option of me being an assassin of some sort. Killing other human beings or animals, I’m not particular, for tidy sums of money. Only problem with this is, I realise that because of the nature of the world now, I might have to kill some rich man or woman somewhere. Ordinarily, this wouldn’t pose a problem, however, what if they were to be the father of a friend, past, present and future? I’d hate to hurt my friends and moreover, I hate to make girls cry. Like it or not, with dead people, there are going to be a lot of spilt female tears, so that eliminates that job. Still, it’s probably the dream job of young males everywhere; being an ultra cool ninja assassin with the power of life and death. But, with great power comes great responsibility. Right? Fucking Hollywood. I’ve heard that one enough times. If there’s one person I’d shoot, it’d be… no wait. Holy shit. There are a lot of people I’d like to shoot. Maybe not kill, but at least kneecap.   With that, I have only legal means left; which means Law school, which means I’ve got to study hard. Damn. Anyone know any other ways of making quick bucks with minimum input?",27
"1am in the morning, raindrops falling heavily on my window sill, solitude, soulful music and an open mind. Everything I need for writing; if I were only in the mood.   This weekend has been one of ceaseless contemplation for me as I wander through my mental valleys and peaks, wondering when I would ever come to the end of my journey. Even then, this sojourn doesn’t seem to make sense at any one point of it. It’s such an abstract world, where everything has ethereal qualities and nothing seems to be real.   I remember once, as a child, I woke up thinking that I was the one human being in this world. That this world was created specially for me and every other person on this planet was just… an angel of some sort, an interactive character whom I could relate to. Kinda like a computer game, where you’re the one main character and everyone else is just some sprite which helps or stops you from completing the game. I just wonder if all this is real, if everything I’m doing actually has some impact.   It’s like taking a walk in the dark, where you don’t know where you’re going or when you’re going to get there. The walk itself makes no sense as you have no sense of direction, inching and feeling your way forward, searching for a light switch which might not even exist.   When walking, there’s always the burning question “What if I stub my foot on something” and this applies to our walk through the darkness. With no sense of direction, nothing to hold on to and no light to show you a path, it’s hard to walk. But walk we must.",27
"I’m going to try to be a verbal artist here; I’m going to paint you a picture of a city. This is an imaginary city. A city where trains are broken and trees are stripped bare. The weather is cold enough that you can see your breath when you exhale and where the smoggy atmosphere permits minute amounts of light to come through. It is dark for most of the day, the only bright hours in the afternoon, and then again, only for 8 of the 24 hours available in the day.   The buildings themselves resemble their citizens; old, weary and vandalized. Graffiti streaks down the walls at every corner, every traffic light and every sign post. It’s a city of hustlers and pimps, where thugs control the streets and pushers and doped out junkies are about as numerous as pimples on an acne-struck teenagers face. Ecstasy changes hands in open daylight and the parents steal marijuana from their children. The kids carry 9mm handguns in their sport bags with a flick knife in their shoes. Basketball practice requires you to bring your gun along with you, in case someone else moves in on your court and a confrontation results. More often than not, weapons are drawn and someone’s blood is spilt. This is a place where the criminals outgun the police. Where the police had .22 handguns and stun batons, the youths had 12 gauge shotguns and grenades.  During the night, when the gangs come out to do battle, the high pitched sprays of Uzi fire punctuated by the deep bass boom of a shotgun plays as the orchestra of the hours of darkness. Screams of anguish are heard and when daylight falls, the remnants of the rumble can be found as bodies remain and bullet holes are scattered on the adjacent walls.   It is a forgotten city, forgotten by the rest of civilization and its own citizens, where each man is truly an island and help is never extended to thy neighbour. Money is always in short supply and all excess is either spent on weapons or drugs. Occasionally, if one is feeling generous, he might bring a few friends to the strip parlour, where he would pay for a lap dance or perhaps… extra services given after hours and off the record. Of course, not that you had to pay anyway, there is no shortage of young girls who’d do anything for you if you told them that you could get them of this hole. The success of a robbery determined whether someone’s child would starve to death tonight. You’re the luckier one if you’re looking down the wrong end of the barrel as you probably have no need to carry out the robbery in the first place.   It is a city with a spirit of desperation; each of the citizens desperate to run away but the question always remains, where to? There is nowhere for them to go, and they know it. Without anywhere to escape, escape is impossible. With most of the school teachers themselves shooting tar heroin into their arms, no one ever gave much thought to academia. The older generations were resigned to their fate, realising that they were doomed to stay in the same place for the rest of their lives and ambition had long left this suburb.   Pretty fucking bleak ey?",27
"ok my couple of days off from work are about to end soon. I felt I was getting some things accomplished on line this week. I still have to fix the mistakes at the other diary page.  No, no I won't drop the name here.  I found some more graphic resources this week that was a plus. I must admit you can go only so far with the kind of graphics I am doing. Which leads me to my next project making the graphics myself.  In my frustration I tend to do things my own way. It takes me a while but I eventually do it. God I need more hard drive space!  I need a new computer!  Don't know when my next day off is? Got to go, wishing wet dreams for everybody :P",28
"before I do research on my bloggy idea, I want make a reality check list.   Listed below is what has been either broken or going wrong with me. This has all happened in the past week.  Things all break at the same time.  I hate it. Is it all over yet? Will more things break or go wrong?  static electricity: I get shocked all the time. At home and at work. It is starting to be painful.  My cats even avoid me I have shocked their little noses one too many time. Poor Murphy and Lilly,  I am sorry. I do what I can but my heating system is not well equiped.  My kids say it is me.  I don't think so.  And if Jay keeps telling me that I need to drink more water he is going to get a water on him.  I drink alot of water already.  dryersheets: Humm now this product is supposed to reduce the static in our clothes.  I got a killer shock from the laundry and bought these thingies.  Well it only helped a bit.  I am still getting shocked. I swear someone is trying to kill me.  washer hose: Well this thing had a nice bubble on it.  Thanks to Jay he noticed it and brought it to my attention so I didn't have water everywhere before I did the next load of laundry.  And the sweet guy that he is he fixed it for me today.  Yeah Yeah Yeah the guy I threatened with the water. Water is good. Water is clean.  He will adjust.  (he knows I am kidding) I also found out where all the socks go when I do the wash. Behind the washer!  Hey bloginfinger go check behind the washer for socks. hahaha  thermostat: This thing just stopped and it is in the middle of winter.  I had company coming over the next day.  We were so cold that night.  I knew how to do it and I wanted to do it myself but the timing was bad ( long story). I do have proof that I can install one though. I am not that hopeless.  Yes Jay helped me installing this also.  He really is good. :)  heating filter: Since the heater is working with such efficiency I thought new filters might help us breathe better. My heater was working poorly and I think still needs a tune up or something.  But before the repairs the downstairs was so cold all the time and upstairs was very hot.  It has evened out now.  This amazes me.  I have no idea why but it does.  Humor me I am a lost soul sometimes.   phone plate: This sucker has been broken for two years now. The phone was disconnecting in the middle of conversations. And recently it was hanging from a wire out of the wall. hahaha ( bad homeowner)  I got this done finally!  I was almost down to one phone in the house. A bad thing for me.  hehehe   oh and my favorite rogaine:  I might have to try this stuff but I am not ready for it yet.  My sister keeps telling me "" I really cannot believe how thin your hair is getting.  You look like Aunt Lucille.""  Aunt Lucille was almost bald before she died.   This is not a compliment and my sister is 11 years older than me.  My sister has a full thick head of hair.  Don't ya love sisters who point things out like this. Well at least it wasn't my mom who would not only point it out but announce it in front of others.  Oh my I had to say that, damn it might come true then.  I should shut up.",28
urlLink lord   urlLink blogfinger   Ok I am posting the above of my two friends that blog like I do.   I am getting another bloggy idea.  hummm  brb,28
"Its been a long time since I have felt the need to post on here.  I have recently decided to pull away from alot of my on line activities.  I am doing some serious introspective thoughts on the work I love to do.  I have never felt I am the best and the brightest at web design or computer graphics, but I can do things that have made other people happy with my results. I help them for what they need on line. It get great pleasure out of helping others. I am proud of what I have done even when I walk away and think I can do better.  I still did it and the challenge is good for me.  I learn constantly which ingnites a fire in me. Not many things in my life have this effect on me. So this thing that I do I am keeping to myself. I am not letting anyone take this little happiness away from me like they have done in the past.  I am pulled in so many different directions to do for others and I do them without hesitation. That is why I sometimes have slow results when finishing a job but it gets done.   This thing that I do is apart of me now. Just like my kids and I we are stuck together like glue.  The little vermin that they are hahahaha!  As my little one would put it ""love you for forever mom!""  ""Same for me sweetie!"" :)  Now for the day time job I go to well I am working 5 days a week. I love this job it is not perfect but the best job I have had in years. The employees are nice and bosses are nice. They work around my hours. THE PAY IS SUCKY! No way around it... it just sucks the big ol wiggola. I was offered a management position but the company reduced the perks of the job. The most important perks in my opinion. For starters money was reduced cause the job is now classified as perminant part - time. What a nice little loop hole to not pay an employee. This also means no insurance benefits.  OHhhh isn't that sweet and caring of them.  Yep, I declined the position.  I like my flexability so I am able to be home with my children.   Now today was fun at work. We got a truck of new product in for the summer season. This stuff we all have fun with. The the two managers and I always vote on what will be a good seller. Cute stuff came in. Very summery. But this one thing that came in was called a banana holder?  I am gonna pay $19.99 for something to hold my bananas? Whatever happened to a fruit bowl on the table?   Now I understand I should not be confusing this with a banana hammock. A totally different entity all together.  To be honest I think the concept would be better for the fruit also. Now the banana holder is hook made of steel and wood and the hammock is made of cotton. I would think the hammock is more practical don't you?  You gotta keep them safe so they don't go soft or bruise. I really think this banana hammock idea is better for a bunch of bananas on my table than that steel hook holder thingy anyday.   Now the original banana hammock that holds the other kind of fruit well lets admit it thats the best fruit there is.  Yeahhhhhhhhhhhhh. :)  I am gonna try to put up Alton Browns website on this blog.  I think he is a trip and I like his show. If you visit his website I posted, go to his rants and raves page and see his post dated March ohh something or other I forget. OHHH damn!! I am old expect this from time to time.  Well...he has some Martha Stewart comments that had me rollin on the floor.",28
roll over the title 'Nothing Accomplished Today' has the link on what I did today. Wow I need to do more than that. I know I can do a better job than that.   Just me,28
"I wanted to get back into the swing of things on my day off.  It is a monday and I am home alone to get some of my online and graphic work done. No such luck. I put a link up at the top here to see if what I made will show up this way.  I put it in the code of this template but you should see a little red x.  I am still trying to fix that.   I have had creative block for about two weeks now and I get very frustrated.  I have about three projects going at once and soon the kids will be off from school and home all day.  No time for me to get my work done. But my block was broken when I decided to create this siggie for this blog. So the good news is I got past my block but I cannot show it.  Oh well,  I will rectify this soon.   Another thing my hair is all cut off. Yep about 5 inches of it. It has been years since I have had short hair. I said yes cause it was getting so thin.  It looks and feels great now. Long hair doesn't always make you look younger. It has to feel good to make you feel younger.  Last week was my youngest sons concert with the band at his school. Now I try not to miss this every year this is so fun to go to.  The music department they have at his school is excellent.  All of the teachers are fantastic. All of the children were wonderful. It was a packed auditorium. We don't care about the heat it is our children up there. *big smiles*    I will describe the closing singing act for the night.  It was the entire 5th grade class and they did a medley of the Beach Boys. He had them do quick costume changes like beach hats and big sunglasses. They just don't sing he makes them act it out. Which is so delightful it leaves a perminant smile on your face. When they got to ""In my room"" they did another costume change putting on thier robes and hugging stuffed animals. It was a hoot. The best entertainment I have seen all year. Great job kids!  My son plays trumpet and has improved greatly this year.  I wonder if it is just me cause I am the proud mom but no his teacher told me too.  He wants to see him back in band with his trumpet next year. He also wants to tutor him this summer to keep it up. My son was so happy to hear this he begged me ""can I please mom?"". My son also got accepted into a singing group this summer he tried to get into last summer. My youngest is 10 and loves music. A great place to put his energy. I really feel the singing class this summer will help with some of his shyness.   I also turned on my girlfriend to this bloggy idea and she has since signed up. Her and I call each other sis cause we feel like family. I will post her link.   Warm Smiles",28
Again I am rushed for time. I have about 5 minutes before I leave for work.  You know how many times in the last week I have opened this blog planning on writing only to close it. This is my situation. My computer sits in an open room in the front living room.  I wish I had a private room for an office with a door and a lock on it.  The kids buzz around me like little gnats annoying me. Then this holiday weekend family just drops over so no way will I get anything done.  I like to write while I am doing laundry or if I am doing a quick dinner.  I also have kids who have school work.  Their computer doesn't have a printer on it. Mine is crappy anyway.  I will buy a new one soon but they will get my crappy one on their computer.  hahaha LOL  It serves a purpose for their school work.  I have not hooked up the internet for them and I don't think I will for a long time.  I basically control this computer cause I have cable hook up which means instant internet. I keep a close eye on them now. Especially the 12 year old who thinks he is 25.  Ohhh that boy is in for a rude awakening.  hahaha    I am still dreading when they are off for the summer. My computer time that is. I have to do graphics and I need concentration. And some of the nudity I deal with I have to do that at night when they are asleep.  I have my drive partioned and password protected.  I am also starting to store my stuff on line in a place that is private.    Ok now I have to go and I don't want to go to work today. I need a rest from this holiday weekend. *waves like a nut to my friends*   I probably spelled something wrong but I am in a rush.  *shrugs* 'THE STORY OF MY LIFE',28
"Today I have one of my days off from work and home alone.  I decided to get serious about me and my future. For all who reads this please understand... that my future always includes my children. But I have to make me healty inside and out.  I know I can do this with my children living with me through it all. I honestly feel that if I am healthy then my children will be.    I tend to make these lists for myself to accomplish some of my goals and maybe one or two things on that list gets done. Currently, some of those things on that list need some real attention and I keep getting scary signs that I cannot ignore anymore. I am not happy with the way I am living my life or my health. The fence that I am on is getting to be a real bitch to balance anymore.  It is a false sense of balance. I do not reccomend this for anyone to live by. But in order for me to change and get off the fence I have to start with one step at a time. It's gonna be slow but I will do it.    First lets tackle my health. I woke up and sat down infront of my computer and I saw this thing I left as a reminder for myself to do. It is a reminder from my health insurance to have a mammogram done. I am 41 and have not had this done yet.  I know how wrong this is but I am scared.  I hear other women say how painful it is and I freeze. The thing that changed my mind today is a coversation I had with one of my customers this weekend.  She is a cancer survivor and her cancer was found early from her mammogram. She told me...""I put mine off too even though I knew cancer was in my family, I wised up just in enough time to have a new life that I am thankful for every day.""   Life is definately more important than being scared.   So I made my appointment today for next week. (the earliest appointment I could get) This is one step closer of feeling proud of me today.   The next step.  Why am I blowing off things like this that are so important to my life. I do know the answer to this one.  DEPRESSION! PRESSURE! STRESS! I need to dig deep inside me and pull out what is stopping me from moving forward with my life.   For example not getting my resume done.  Oh I typed one a million times but I destroy them. I see myself on paper and automatically put myself down. 'Whos gonna hire me. Too many holes in my employment.' I have asked for help from some family and friends with my resume but they can only help so much. I am the one who has to do it not them.    I cry alot more than I admit to anyone.  I hide alot of feelings. Only a few people in my life know how I really feel. Only one of them lives close to me. My personal life with relationships is horrible for me right now.  I really cannot talk about it on here.   So the step I made towards this today is I called a psychological center today to find a good therapist. I am waiting for a phone call back to make an appointment.  I need to be fixed. I need help.  I give up!  This is too much for me to handle alone.   Third step. Temporary things help me cope like purging.  I have been cleaning out this house throwing so many things out that should have been thrown out a long time ago. I have a rule if it hasn't been useful, played with, doesn't fit, is broken,or is ugly it goes out the door.  I find we accumulate alot of junk.  I have to give some credit to some of those TV shows that are cleaning out houses.  They have inspired me to clean out and get organized. It feels good to actually find a room that you can enjoy when all the junk has been thrown out. Very cathartic!   So today I would say is a three step proud day for me.",28
"Well for starters I did go for my mammogram and got my results back.  They didn't find anything. That is a big relief. Now my thoughts on the process well... it really wasn't that bad. The pain was minimal. The place was a newly built specialized women's center and they treated you nicely.  I think they know how tense we are when we get there. They did a lot to make you feel so comfortable. The technician I had was very sweet and professional.  She did comment on the cut I had on my arm from work. Her comment was ""how did you get that it looks like it hurts?"" Well at my work I do some heavy physical work and use a box cutter. I never get cut with this thing it is usually the boxes that cut me.  It hurts a lot and deep too. Actually this cut was not as bad as the other ones I have had. She told me it is probably because my skin is so fair the cut looks so pink.   Well that is me I am whiter than white bread.  I don't tan anymore.  I either burn or get freckles. I work too much to get to the beach in the summer as often as I would like. I love the shore. I could be on the beach everyday and never get bored. That reminds me I need to buy new kites this year. The boys and I love flying them. So if I buy them then it will force me to make some day trips down the shore. The convenience of having the beach only an hour away is great. One of my goals in life is to have a place to live down there and stay all year round.  Ahh, just to relax and hear the ocean everyday would be great.   My appointment with my new therapist is in about two weeks.  I am really looking forward to it. If I am purging the house I need to purge me too.  I need to get out of my rut and move on with life.   I have pushed myself to do more siggies. I am finding my own way anymore. I start a tutorial and end up doing my own thing anyway. I am also branching out getting other kids of ideas to make for banners and backgrounds. The new stuff I am learning with brush techniques is fascinating me.  I have learned how to make my own custom brushes out of anything. My imagination is endless. I have even been thinking of a new banner to do for a friends website. I am going to use original material too like great nature shots I have from his digital camera. Well, actually he has challenged me to do it.  He has no idea what he started in my brain with this one. LOL I just got some great filters to make stuff look like realistic glass and metal textures. So I am having a party in my head right now. :P  I have been going back and forth between both programs PSP and Photoshop.  PSP has been more versatile for me. I just had to do maintence on a webpage I did earlier this year. I am happy when the client is happy.  The hard part for me is the pricing. I do it as I go along.  I can have flat fees for things but when someone wants maintenance that gets into gray area.  If they want a new face lift for the site then well that is more than maintenance.  The client doesn't know how much goes into it.  It is so hard to explain to them. Also when the client messes with the page too well you have to keep some opinions to yourself.  You have to disconnect from it and let the emotions go from all the work you put into it. OHhh here is the  urlLink web page . I just redid the sound clips and other things.    I have a couple of siggies to do tonight. I also think I will post some of my current work on my personal web space and link it in here. I have to go there and transfer files yadda yadda yadda. Next I will do a blog about my part-time, retail circus lovin, dependable paying, job.  hahaha  Keep it wet people. *big kisses*",28

I'm the casual space enthusiast who doesn't go to space.com everyday but gets quite excited when something is happening up/out there. Even more when the event is influenced by humans. Last night Cassini made it and is now in orbit around the planet. Woohoo! Congratulations to everyone involved.  urlLink Saturn Orbit Insertion | Metafilter,29

"Its close to impossible. Not just becuase most IB kids are doing homework from the time they get home till they have to wake up between four and five in the morning, but because the selection is so low. Its really quite sad, especially for Kemps Landing Alumni.  You see, there are one hundered PIB freshman. Of those one hundered students, roughly twenty to thirty are male. Out of those, about eleven or twelve are not Kemps Landing Alumni. Out of those, one has a girlfriend, several are most likely gay, and the rest, well, hardly suitable.  Well, why not date those other male students? The answer is quite simple. At least for me and my friends, its not so much that they aren't dating worthy, but its just either they are really good friends or theyve taken on brotherly qualities.  Well, why not date out of the regular student population? Most of our classes are with other IB students, therefore, only a couple classes are taken with regular students, and its hard to get to know them. Not to mention, we appreciate intelligent conversation.. Im wondering how long Im going to have to endure being single.  And wow, this post sounds reallly awful of me.",31
"Since IB students are worked extra hard, generally get less sleep, and have to wake up extra early to catch a bus for a school that is on the other side of the city, it would make sense that for the SOLs, they would provide a split bus schedule for inzone kids, but not out of zone IB kids. Let me explain, during the weeks of SOLs, you dont technically have to go to school until 9:55 if you don't have a test. Thus, there are two bus runs for in zone kids, one for those who are taking a test, and one for those who aren't. IB kids aren't so lucky. Its either, get a ride, or come into school and sit in a study hall for two hours.  I guess there is really nothing to complain about, but a couple of extra hours of sleep would be nice. I'm still going to be catching the bus at a quarter past six though. The only good thing about having a forty minute bus ride is that it is a perfect opportunity for you to b.s. your block one homework.",31
"I suppose that if anyone at all is reading this and is familliar with the International Baccalaureshit program they might be wondering how in the world I can be a freshman in IB. Typically, the IB programs spans a students junior and senior years in highschool to prepare them for college. Pre IB, then, is to prepare students for the actual IB academy program.  Essentially, its like putting an innocent person in the stocks and hitting them with half-eaten apples before actually carrying out their sentence, whatever it may be.  It strikes me as interesting that they need a program to prepare for a prepetory program. What's ever more interesting is the 'Early Years' program that my city is establishing in one of the middle schools; a middle school program that is for, ironically enough, the prepartion of young student for the IB program.  And yet, as the standards of IB are being raised with every passing state test, as all schools in fact, are raising their standards, the average student is becoming more lazy, less educated, and in many cases, essentially illiterate. So much, in fact, that the Virginia Standards of Learning Tests (SOLs) are under hot debate. The question? Shoule we get rid of them, becuase they are too hard for the average student. It's incrediblly hard, and I'm not trying to sound like an eliteist or whatever else they've been calling IB students these days, for an IB kid to comprehend how in the world the SOLs can be too difficult. We fail to realize that while we worry about paswsing advanced, most kids worry about whether or not they're going to pass at all. I suppose its even harder for me to understand this seeing as I went to the one and only middle school magnet program for many, many miles (by that I mean like magnet schools are hardly anywhere). And because I had that 'gifted education' the Pre IB program is extremely easy for me and basically filled with a bunch of nonsense busy work. I'm anticipating a fairly easy introduction to the IB program, and most people who graduate with an IB diploma find that college is a whole lot easier than their actual high school IB classes. I guess then, that all the preperation is good, but for us students, its like living in hell.",31

And guess what?! He weeped infront of us because wimpy still wants samantha and cant take it when wimpy sees her with me!  Samantha is a sweet, attractive and kind-hearted lady whom recently just found her long-lost mummy of 20 yrs... She couldnt snap out of this guilt wimpy has been poisioning her for yrs... And God did wimpy claim he still luvsssss her... my arse!  Reason she's still in contact with wimpy because 1) the guilt 2)friendship but Low and Behold, here is the definition of FRIEND taken from dictionary.com: 1)A person whom one knows, likes, and trusts. 2)A person whom one knows; an acquaintance. 3)A person with whom one is allied in a struggle or cause; a comrade. 4)One who supports, sympathizes with, or patronizes a group, cause, or movement: friends of the clean air movement. 5)Friend A member of the Society of Friends; a Quaker. Thats exactly what i explained last night or rather early this morning except #5...  I know this is a little confusing... NO, sammy's not my gal *yet* and YES, we know how we felt for each other but because of wimpy and friends... things just got complicated... I hate it when a gentle person be it HIM, HER or SHIM (though i have way lesser tolerant for them) gets abused emotionally and mentally... These characters are used for the better of those around you not just to your advantage! Bloody hell... bugger off kenneth wimp! If it was not for samantha i swear this would end the savage way...  Ah btw, sammy said wimpy stared at me few weeks back when he was waiting in q to black... why din you just walk up and hit me? Aint got any balls huh? If i had knew that wimp crying was you, nah i wont hit you, at least not infront of sammy...",33

"Can you remember the best or worst day of your life? Is it the same day? There is a single day of my childhood that stands out among the memories. I recall these events with great anxiety and fear, as well as great joy and relief. This day was among the best, and the worst. The day started out like most others. Then an unexpected chain of events lead to an unexpected conclusion. 	As a child in the second grade, life is typically care-free. Eight year old boys usually worry about the new G.I. Joe or Transformer action figure and play set. Getting on and off the school bus was my biggest responsibility. The school I attended would pick up the elementary students at the end of the day and bus them to the high school to wait for those students to board. This lead to about a ten minute wait for the elementary students, who were allowed to get off the bus and play in the courtyard until the high school dismissed. So with that ten minutes of freedom, my friend and I departed the bus and began to do what little boys do best, run and play. However, the daily routine would soon be broken. 	The routine went something like this. The high school students would dismiss and board the buses, followed by the roar of the buses diesel engines cranking up. This was our signal to find our way back to the appropriate bus and get on for the ride home. On this day, however, my friend and I took our time making the short trip back to our big, yellow mode of transportation. We bounced along kicking rocks, jumping from anything we could climb on, and playing in the dirt. For an eight year old boy, the shortest distance between two points is a skewed line. Our pace quickened, however, when we noticed the lead buses pulling away. Running up to our bus we found nothing but a folding, glass and metal door that was shut tight. I can remember the expression on the drivers face. Without a word she said it all, she was making a point, and no matter how much we beat on the door, she wasn’t going to open it. She just shook her head and said, “No”.  My friend and I watched that bus, and many more pull out of the lot. I had never seen that lot empty, until now. It was an unfamiliar territory. 	We started to make our journey on foot, walking up a busy street that lead to the overpass and our neighborhood on the other side of the interstate. I remember being so scared of being run over or picked up by some evil person. The worst thought though, was what my mother was going to say or do. The awful and swift punishment I would receive couldn’t match being run over by a truck. Just before we made it to the overpass, my friends’ mother pulled up beside us. This was all made possible by my brother, who had made it onto the bus in the first place, and was already home. On the ride home, I tried to be as invisible as possible. My friends’ mother let us know how she felt about our adventure. She was not pleased. I knew that I would get the same treatment when I arrived home, and I was petrified. In my minds eye, I could see my mothers’ belt, affectionately known as “White Lightning”, just lying there, waiting to dispense punishment. My friends’ mother dropped me off at my house and I prepared for the worse. However, my wild imagination was wrong. There were no belts cracking, no beatings, no yelling or reprimanding. Only the smell of home-made pizza and the loving embrace of my concerned mother. She wasn’t mad, and she had made pizza for supper! That was too much, I didn’t believe it. 	That day in my childhood is, without a doubt, the worst and greatest. It was an emotional roller coaster that stands out among my thousands of experiences and will remain with me forever.",34

I have come to the conclusion that she doesn't like me. If you like someone you would have respect for them. Though she has no respect for me. She punces me, hits me, socks me, hurts me. I guess I shouldn't even try next time. I was asleep awhile ago and she IMed me and said, ""your ignoring me on purpose."" I am so glad I was asleep, I don't want to be apart of her games anymore. I am just going to stop liking her someway or another. I won't stare at her anymore in math class or anything, won't laugh at her jokes even though it might be funny, or I won't do anything.",35
"Today was a good day. i am starting to see the world again for what it was to me before. No more drama, just fun and sunshine. Yes the sun arose from the dead and gave me everlasting heat today. I kept sticking arm and head out the window on the cardrive home. Well yeah, i wish school can be like today. And i have decided i am going to wear my shorts to school tomorrow. :D",35
"Today was the day after the mercury incident. A student of the eight grade brought with him some mercury to school with him in the morning. Little did he know that people can die of mercury if shallowed and other things. In my second period, a classmate of mine had found some mercury on the floor. My science teacher said to sit away and immediately called the attendence office. From the science class, we had to move up to the football field and continue our work there, while the room get clean.  i have touched some of the mercury but hadnt taken any with me to any classes. but yeah i could be poisoned. after i learned what mercury could do to a person, i started worrying. though my other teachers said that you can only get affected if you drank lots of amounts of it. woot thank goodness.. well that day, the liberal arts building in the school was shut down due to mercury in the classroom and hallways. Today, classes in the room, like mine, would had to go to the library where we would stay far away from the poisonous substance. In the library for science, some guy came in and asked us if we were wearing the same shoes as yesterday. i said yes with a couple of other people and we had to get our shoes inspected for mercury.. man we had a lot of mercury on our shoes. they had this device that measured the mercury, kinda like a metal detector. if a student had a lot, they would have to get their shoes cleaned. blah  blah.. i had my shoes cleaned and it took a long time. i missed nutrition, but i managed to get some food.. woot.  well today i socked jonathan on the head which felt real good. i gave him a good bleeding on the leg with a kick which made me really happy. and yeah things with me and reina havent been going well. well she socked me today and i didnt want to talk to her at all. that way she would know i am trying to be serious and that i dont like her socking me. i dunno. well yeah im bored.. blah blah",35
"I have realize something better doing, than making people look stupid with their own words. Making people smile, with my words, gifts, actions, and more, are better than that. Knowing that someone is having a good time in their life because I have been there. I try to do good deeds for friends, and be romantic for her. and I do. And when I do, I get a smile. There are some things in life living for, and this is one of it. Others are like; family; friends; and some, I did not discover yet. Give kind, and recieve it. Thats why I'm saying now-a-days. No one likes to be punched out of respect from the person. Everyone wants respect even if you deny it. Though me, people know be as out-going, and sometimes miss my respect by a mile and think I don't care about what they say. I have tried to change the wt I go about things, comment things, use things, but I always fail and go back to the same me. Maybe there is no change me, unless I have to discover more life lessons to change my ways. I don't know if this idea of making people smile will ever stick with me. I mean people have their moods and I know I have em.  I have a school mood which is my out-going-kind-of-person, and then there is my life lessons, I'm so in love, lets write in a journal person. And when both moods cross, its kinda weird. And I have seen it been weird by the comments I GET from people.",35
"Well yeah. I was talking to her today and she said she would come to my house on monday, which is tomorrow. I told her i wanted to meet her at the bottom of the hill instead. Though the subject changed quick. It came back up again. I asked her what she was doing tomorrow, and she said her friend was gonna come over. She asked me why i asked, and I said i wanted to take a walk with her. And then it happened. She said she would blow off her friend and come with me. But i know her for a long time and still i dont even know if she was joking or not. I mean she signed off right in my face without us finishing our conversation. I am kinda having a feeling that something good might come. But these feelings come up too often and they pass too quick. So i dont even know what to believe anymore. Like I said, she flirts with everyone. Though i dont think she even likes me, ANYMORE. We used to be so so so so close together. Like as if we were bf and gf. It didnt even matter if it wasn't the real thing, it was life the real thing, though no one has to get the permission to break away. Im just wasting my life dedicating time to someone who won't do the same thing back. Well i can wait till tomorrow, or should i mean today.. it is 1:39, which means it is monday. Ill call her in the morning and see what comes up. I really want to be alone with her, just for at least 30 minutes, that is NOT at school rounds. hand out. yenno what i mean. i mean i only se her during school, so this is my chance. I have a while week, the whole spring break to dig, or do something, and find out the facts i need to come to my last conclusion.",35
"Today I woke up with the sun shining into my room. It felt great and it is very rare that the sun would be up in 6 o'clock in the morning. Though it was a hot day, today was pretty cool. Justine does like the touching. HAHA. I knew it. Shes a horny. Today during lunch, I got a little crazy with my shoulder action. I went to Chris Epps house and Darwin came. We had fun playing basketball and baseball, then we went to Kurt's house across the street. Kurt is getting a swimming pool which is very cool. If I had lighter skin, I would swim a lot. Though me in water for a long period of time equals dark dark. I want to make a website, but its so hard finding a website. Websites are fun to make. And aww shit. I just forgot about the contest on shadowness. FUCK. The winner gets a year long account of uploading anything like music, html files, and all kinds of shit. Man the dead line was on CINCO DE MAYO. Damn Mexican destractions.",35
"Yeah I can last without her. And yet, people now know of my ""angry"" side. If you do something to me, I will take my revenge. I didn't mind them taking my wallet and playing monkey in the middle, but looking in it, supposively taking my money, and dropping the contents of it really got me pissed. I was never good at saying sorry, and I'm still not. So I guess I'll just let this problem hang. Her and her buddies in math are so immature. I mean I do jokes and stuff, but saying nipple out loud in math class isn't really funny. They are like the only ones laughing. Lately I'm just trying to get the respect of people. I got a lot of respect right now, but there are still a lot of people who just think they can boss me around because I play along with comments, or being very quiet. Having multiple personalites are a tuffy.",35
". . . I once said, that her last impression was bad, but little did I know, it wasn't. I thought that me, Christopher Paguio, would have to wait all the way to next school year to hear her beautiful voice. She calls me, and even though I don't pick up, she takes the time to leave a message. A message that made me smile, a  real  smile, a smile that I haven't had since school ended. . . . In the past, I said to myself, that I would never fall for her again. It's just impossible to not do that. Just to take this chance everytime with her is worth it, even though the outcome may not be the best. She broke my hearts many time with her flirt-a-licous personality, and I always hid my jealousy. But now it's different. School is over, and seeing her through the summer can put away her seductive words closed, but open to me.",35
"I think I am too emo for life. I am just sitting here listening to the Copeland soundtrack, thinking about me in the future. Just a while ago I was thinking that I would never want to grow up. Like I mean I've been thinking about me, living without my parents money. I would be worrying about those taxes, those payments, those responsibilities. Well, part of me is saying that I shouldn't be worrying about whats in the future, and I should be concentrating on the present. And the other part of me, is just, afraid. I don't know. too much drama in my life. Too many heartbreaks. I love emotions, and emotions love me. I just don't know what to do. I want to master life, I want the best out of life. I am afraid of dying. I afraid of where I will go after I die. I wonder to myself if I am doing good, or bad. I want to do good. hmm. maybe I should think this whole thing over. til next time.",35
"Hmm.. Sad topic is: Break Up My sister's boyfriend broke up with her yesterday. Of course she really loved him. I thought he was cool. He came over to our house once in a while, and even came to church with us. He bonded good with our family. I hate to see my sister cry. I mean yeah you know you don't like to see a family member of yours cry. I knew she felt bad and she didnt go to school that day. I wanted to cheer her up, but i didn't know what to say. she will find a new boyfriend, we all know it.",35
"Since my last post, i guess I should explain my love of H.R. Personnel, as it will make more sense for those who aren't in the know. To put it blunty I don't like H.R. people. Not the individual mind you, but the job. Really. Makes me vomit up bits of internal organs to even think about it. That said, here goes my spleen -      Before I go too far, let me re-verify my statement above, it's not the individual, it's the profession... I know programmers who love Visual Basic, I know people who prefer to eat their salads with salt and pepper, etc. Short explanation - even good people do bad things. It's in our nature. However, I cannot understand the inherent evil that is the HR job.  Now more specifically, I really really dislike the recruiters.  The avg HR joe who takes my call about a question on insurance, dental plans, etc is doing just fine in my book. They serve a need and they do it the way they think best. Fine. But those smug faced, lie spewing recruiter types, well, damn.  If you ever go to a career fair, you'll be surrounded by them, if you go to a college-style interview, you'll meet them. Some companies make you go to meetings filled with them. if you haven't met these types, count yourself lucky, and to try to help you spot them, I've written up some quick tell-tale signs :  Do they smile ALL THE TIME?  I mean, the kind of smile that looks like it was created by having the muscle fiber in their face altered, or maybe it's one of those freaky clear plastic masks, whatever, it's the first warning sign.  Do they talk really loud? are they exuding energy from their very pores? if so, another warning sign.      here's the worst one though - if someone is singing a company song, call it done. Same deal if there is a company chant, company dance, company sexual position, whatever. In fact, if the company has a song or a chant they do at meetings, might want to consider a job move.  I've had my fair share of experiences with the HR Demon. I've had to write a report saying i was sorry (3rd grade anyone?) I've had to do a fucking dance. I've had to watch them cheer and run across the stages telling everyone how wonerful their slave-style job was.  However, one occurence will always stay with me.  I saw one of the college recruiters walking out of work one day. I was slightly behind and to the side of her, so she did not notice me, but I had a good view of her profile. She seemed kinda off for some reason, like she was in a hurry to get out or something. Noticing this, I decided to see what was up.  That bitch wore her widest ass shit-eating grin the whole 1/2 mile walk through the parking lot to her car. She gets in, shuts the door, turns on her air-conditioning.... slumps way down in her seat and just relaxes her facial musclies.  It was the most amazing thing I'd ever seen. The smile gone, she put her blazer in gear and headed home.  I almost felt sorry for her until the next week when she made myself and some other guys play a ""team-building exercise game""  Evil bitch",36
"OK, was talking to my boy Kaleb tonight, mentioned a recent career fair I'd been to here on campus, so here goes my take on it.  Career Fairs are pretty much bullshit. I say pretty much, cause every once in awhile, it has to do something for someone, or else why would people still go? maybe it's like an urban legend for the unemployed college student, like ""I know this guy, who knew this guy who's roommates dog's groomer got a job through one"". Anyways, so here was my experience at my most current Career Fair visit:  I go in, dressed down by typical attendee standards, but dressed up by typical ComSci guy standards (slacks and a sportscoat, no tie, if you cared).  I had my handful of resume's printed on the expensive, off-white paper that you're supposed to (who started that trend anyways? what difference does it really make over standard 20# paper? probably a paper manufacturer, greedy bastards).  So I go and decide to whore myself out for a job op.  Now if you've never been to one of these before, let me explain the setup to you: a really big open room, full of folding tables with big signs proclaiming the name of the company, and lots of free crap like pens and hats and stuff. There are usually 2-4 reps per company there to tell you how great the company is, and answer your questions. These are not the people you'd work with most of the time but H.R. people. My close friends know my feelings about H.R. people, but that's another story. So you go and say ""Hi, I'm such and such, I'm pursuing my degree in such and such, and I'd like to work for your Company, or one of any company here who'll have me, I dont' really care"". They say ""great, let me see your resume"" and then either ""thanks, we'll keep this around"" or ""we probably don't have much for you right now, but I'll hold on to it just in case"". Depending on your major they may just laugh you out and throw poo at you.  here's where it gets really annoying:  case 1 - myself - B.S. in CS GPA of 3.11 - currently seeking my M.S. IN CS with GPA of 4.0 - here were the two most common answers for me - ""We can't recruit for anything but entry level positions here, and we couldnt' do that for you, too much experience"" and ""wow, this looks great, but we don't have any openings for IT people, and you're probably not Management type"".  Wow.. neat... the first one really pisses me off, makes me think, you know, if your boss knew you passed up a willing experienced person who would work for entrylevel pay, would he fire you then or wait til your next performance eval?""  but this isn't as bad as:  case 2 - My sister - graduates this semester with her B.S. in history. ya, history, I know, no job right? but get this - she is a member of 4 different honor societies, has a 3.9 GPA and could rock your fucking socks off in just about any academic endeavor she wanted to. Most well read person I know, and a grand employee at the library. Now, I know she's not the salesmen type, but I'm sure that your company could find some sort of position that she can handle. Do you not have any clerks, analysts, or researchers at your company? Jeez. the worst part was, not only did she only get to hand over 1 resume, 4 people told her straight to her face to go away, or brushed her off. How great is that?  Since half these companies can't afford new blood, they were probably there to build goodwill... not a great way to go about that.  oh, and on our way out, I stopped by one last kiosk in hopes of gettign some kind of info - ""we have intern positions for H.R. only"" Christ.",36
"It just occured to me that the ending of my last post might confuse people - coffee and sleep... heh. I'm a hella huge caffeine addict. Get the shakes if I don't have the bean every day. Seriously.

"Hi, what a long day it's been for me. So I thought I'd come here and dump a brain-load on the web, maybe make me feel better. I think everyone has wondered what life would be like if we'd made different choices. This is not going to be a post about that. This is going to be a post about people who sit around waxing philosophical or political all the time.     Screw that. Who's got the time?     Why are we so damn whiny? It's like - look people, it doesn't matter, cause you DID make that choice, and that's it. You don't get to go back. So shut up already and do something useful. What I'm doing now is not useful, so I should beat myself up over it, but for some reason, I just don't wanna. so here goes:  1. - You can't change the past, forget about it. 2. - You are VERY unlikely to change peoples personal views and beliefs, no matter how much you argue, and what you say, unless that person is really searching for an answer and think you can give it to them. 3. - Opinions aren't right or wrong, don't get so uptight about it. 4. - No matter how many mean looks you get from teachers, peers, or anyone else, you should be able to speak your mind freely. 5. - The people who tend to preach Free Speech and Open Minds mean only theirs, not yours. remember that the next time you decide to promote Pro-Life, Anti-Drug, or any other ""right wing-redneck-know nothing-bumpkin"" viewpoint.  Just some thoughts. Read ""The New Thought Police"" by Tammy Bruce - it will make you think twice about the support the left wing gives to ""free speech"".  Startled me to see I agreed more with a Classic-Liberal Gun-owning Lesbian Journalist than with any politician I can think of.  I'm out - need coffee and sleep.",36
"OK, well the test post seems to have gone through, so I figure maybe I should introduce myself to my blog, and to whoever reads it, and maybe just in case I come up with amnesia, it'll help me out sometime.  Provided I can remember to view the blog of course.  My name is Phillip Martin, I live in Oklahoma (currently Stillwater).  Have a B.S. in Computer Science, working on my Master's degree after having been laid off by Worldcom back in June of 2002. I am married, wife's name is Shanna, we met back when I was a Sophomore, October of 1997. Got married in February of 2001 on the 10th. Send us anniversary presents if you'd like.  Graduate school is not totally my bag, having a time readjusting to school life, especially since most of my friends have graduated or gone. A few have come back, as I did, some just left after I got here, and others are just MIA.   It is weird how many people I still know here, and how little ""College Life"" has really changed overall. Frat guys and sorority girls still wear those damn T-Shirts. I can still spot the pseudo intellectuals from 3 latte's away, and of course, the afternoon-after partier, still reeking of stale beer and cigarettes while sitting next to you in the Student Union Foodcourt. The opinion writers in the school paper still write from a position showing a real lack of knowledge of the world beyond highschool/college (with the exception of maybe C. Brook Kurtz, who has apparently returned to OSU with me).  One thing that glares at me, is the absence of Preacher Bob (not his real name).  I miss that guy, was very entertaining.   Anywho - I'll get off the College hasn't changed and everyone's still stupid soapbox now. I'm hoping this will be an entertaining enough first post - and if not, go read my buddy Brian's post about his Critical Analysis class on his little blog over  urlLink  here    Later all",36

"OK Ok, happy posting time.  We had a few puppies about two weeks ago. We are now getting a few of them with opening eyes. Woot!  They're all very cute and cuddly.  I took them to Shanna's job tonight, so her co-workers and clients could see them.  Shanna works at a place called Stillwater Group Homes, they provide in-home health and life care for physically and mentally handicapped people.  Her clients are pretty severe, but their faces lit up when they saw our little furballs.  It was sweet, cute, and heartwarming. So there, I'm not such a negative fella eh?",36
"After reading my own words.. well wow.  I'm a negative son of a bitch. Maybe we could all use a little extra sunshine in our day. Perhaps I could be the one to give it to us all!!!    Well, sorry folks, I'm not that cheery.  However, I had an interesting conversation tonight and I think I'd like to share it with you. It isn't so much negative or positive, but I thought it was interesting, and if any of you wonder about how your Teachers and Teaching Assitants feel about classes, maybe it could give you some insight into their own thoughts and feelings.  I was up at my office this evening, grading a few papers, logging the grades and all that rot. Ya, did it on a Sunday evening, grades being distributed Monday. Graduate students forget that weekends exist, they're just the days we don't have to go to a class.   Regardless, a couple of other TA's were there, and also a TA who has recently been appointed to a lecturer position.  A big rumor has apparently started to come up in the department, seems we may not have enough financing to pay for all the TA's next semester, maybe not even enough for any of the Master's students to work at all. Being a MS student myself, this does indeed concern me. We all started talking about our alternatives. My head TA, a fellow who started the same time as me and who I think totally rocks, said that he'd heard of students who abandon their college and quit being TA's in the middle having a hard time returning to a program at said college.  He was afraid to go job hunting because of this, as it could require him to withdraw from the univeristy, and lose the good graces of the faculty.  At this point I began to wonder, ""who cares?"" I mean, if they can't support us to help them teach their classes (and I think a lot of you would be surprised by how much a TA really does for their students, especially in a technical discipline)  why should we bother to give up oppourtunity to make them happy? At this point I found the rift between myself and my associate. I did not come into the Master's program so that I could teach, I didn't come into it because of my great love for learning in a university setting. I did it for two reasons - financial asylum, and expanding my potential job oppourtunities.  He also came seeking these things, but would like to be a professor later in his life.  At this point - the person who is now a lecturer chimed in with ""why I can't say that I know for sure that you'll be working next semester, it would still be a good idea to keep your prof's happy"".  All of a sudden I wanted to scream.  you know, that warning lamp goes off in your head, your eyes cross, you get nauseated...  and I think. wait, he's a lecturer, working on his PhD, here so he can become a Prof.  Then it made sense and I calmed down a lot.  You see it boils down to what we're looking for. The lecturer needs his PhD.. that's all there is to it, he plan on becoming a Prof immediately.  The head TA - he wants to work, got laid off like I did, and would also like to be a prof (when he retires from industry he says). Myself, I just want the market to get better so I can go back to the life I had.   While we're all different on that, it makes sense, and we all know where we're at.  Here's where it got really neat though:  The lecturer mentioned how lucky we were to be TAing CS 1.  I immediately thought - what the hell are you talking about?  But the weird thing was that the Head TA agreed!  Now I had been complaining to a lot of my old buddies about CS 1.  It comes down to this:  They enjoy the challenge of getting people to learn something they dont' have the slightest understanding of.  I do not. I cannot stand the whining and complaining I get daily from the business students, the stat students, and everyone else. BUT I do enjoy teaching. I did it for free at my old high school while I was working at Worldcom. The difference  comes in that I like to teach those who are willing to learn.. who want it. because they don't complain that the material doesn't matter to them, that it is useless, and that they just want their C so they can go on. The people who want it are driven, or at least curious, and that makes all the difference.  What happens to us next semester? who the hell knows. What happens if we get job offers today, and are required to start next month? well, I for one would take it, tell my profs to kiss my ass, and go for it. I would love to complete it, and most likely would in my spare time.  The Head TA ? he'd be very conflicted. He's extremely loyal, likes the institution of higher learning, and wants to make sure he keeps the prof's happy. I told him to take the job, come back before he retires, all these profs will be dead or gone, and know one would be around to be mad that he'd left.  The lecturer? well he'll probably stay anyways, and since his Degree is being paid for, he doesn't have that much leverage.  One thing for everyone to remember please - TA's are students on top of your little helpers. They sometimes write your assignments, they almost always grade them, and they are severly underpaid. Don't blame them when you fail, don't make fun of them for looking weird (try sleeping avg of 3 hours per night from working instead of partying) and for the love of god, show them some resepect.  Out.",36
"well well well, I've been married for 2 years today. Neato.  thats the happy thought for today. Much too tired to keep that stuff up. Well, I've just finished the first round of tests for this semester, no matter what kind of college student you are, it feels good to be done with them. For me, it doesn't help that I have more work to do than a cheap whore during shore leave.  I have papers, programming projects, grading, and all manner of family obligations to attend to.  So why am I here writing? cause it's the easiest thing on the list to do.  Let me discuss this whole testing thing for a bit.  Lets get it straight - tests make up the majority of your grade. They are very short in length compared ot most of the other work done for classes (unless you're a business major whose only coursework are the tests themselves, I took the classes, don't pretend that's not true, your ruse of ""group projects"" be damned). Exams are also a high-stress activity, usually preceded by much caffeine, nail biting, and overactive reading.  Now maybe my methods wont' work for a lot of you, maybe they will, but hell, here's my advice to all you test takers, and even if you're not taking tests, we all get quizzed from time to time.  Here's what helps me (use at your own risk).  Wear comfy clothes.  No use being uncomfortable, trying to look good for the ladies (or guys as the case may be).  Trust me that no one else in class is checking you out during this test.  Being comfortable is the first part of being able to focus your mind.    Eat somethign earlier in the day, but do not eat right before the test.  You don't want a gurgling belly irritating you, but you dont' wanna get all dreamland sleepy when trying to remember what the fuck the symbol for projection in relational algebra looks like (it's a large pi symbol btw).    Don't cram right before the exam. Take a freaking break and play some ping pong or something. Those last second mindscrapes usually end up confusing most of us.  It wouldn't hurt to give a cursory glance through some examples right before the exam starts, but if it's 2 hours beforehand, take a breather.  Studying the night before is cool tho.     Study groups only work if you actually study material.. They don't work if you're talking about bullshit.  It's been my expereince that the majority of ""study groups"" turn into a social gathering in about 20 minutes. Either try to steer the conversation back to study, try to excuse yourself early, or plan ahead so that you can get your people thinking about any questions you have in that first 20 minutes.    Finally, when you're taking the test - focus on it like a motherfucker.  If you don't know the answer to one question skip ahead to the next, don't waste time pondering until you're certain you've got everything that is ""for sure"" down.  Then go back and do those other questions. for some people this is a time thing, but for me, sitting around trying to do something I""m not sure of breaks my concentration, gets me out of that ""zone"".  Whichever, it's a tried-and-true strategy.  That ""zone"" is your best mofoing buddy when you're testing, you'll be able to remember things, maybe even recall whole pages of diagrams and such.    Finally, don't study too much. this is very possible, and will seriously screw you. go over your reading twice and be done with it. you have a question about something, get it answered, remember the answer and stop.  You can overstudy, and it will screw with your head.    Oh ya, and the best tip you'll ever get - go to fucking class, and listen when you're there. put down your calculator with the games, put down the palm pilot with your scribble drawings, hell, put down your pen and just listen. Profs arent' talking to hear themselves, they'd rather not be there either. but it's what makes it work, and they know more than you do, I promise.  I don't know that I've ever had a class where 90% of all the test material wasn't touched on in class.     Another thing - studies show that you can do better on an exam if you can recreate the environment in which you studied the material. So if you learn it in class, all the better, but if you learn it on your own, try to minimize things that you have around you that you won't have in class (like beer, loud music, and your computer screen).  I'm out.",36
"Hello Bloggy blog. I know I haven't posted in damn near forever, but I'm back with style now baby.  Well, lets catch you guys up a bit. I have done more work this last month than a man should in three.  I also have some important announcements regarding me:  1) I am now local ACM president at OSU, so bow down. 2) I got hired for a contract to work on a game that I've been looking forward to for a couple of years now (more on that in a bit) 3) all our puppies have been given good homes, and 4) I am still unemployed.  OK, now onto the more exciting bits of that - the game dev thing especially.  Back when I was a kid, my dad bought our first computer. It was a 286. It was wonderful.  We went through more than a few upgrades over the next few years, so I can't remember which iteration of hardware we were on when I started playing the game that changed my young little life. The Bard's Tale.  My goodness I loved that game. Played it for hours on end. Beat it and thought I was the biggest badass around.  It was first person oriented Computer RPG, similar to the wizardry series (but a bit more interesting in my opinion).  Anyways, I loved this game dearly. Fast Forward to 2 years ago - I find that there is a group of indy developers working a game that is ""loosely based"" on Bard's Tale. I was ecstatic, I went and checked out the website and all that rot.  It looked grand and totally took me back to being an 11 year-old in front of dad's PC.  So I joined up on the mailing list.  Well, I go back every few months, and the game does seem to advance (albeit slowly, these guys are all doing this in their spare time).  The game goes through some major revisions and all that.  Lately, it's started too look like it's getting close to being finished, and I toss off the random email offering my services to help test or even do some extra dev work they got layin around, as I want to get the ball moving so I can play this darn game.  They were cool about it and said they'd offer me some testing stuff.  A few weeks later lo and behold, I get an email saying, hey, we ran into a snag with one of our developers, you care to jump in and get some stuff doen for us?  Of course I jump on it, they said there were a few others who were interested, and they'd have to check into all of us, but in the end i got picked. So yippie yay me!  I'm rocking the hisouse now, and I'll even get a share of the profits from teh game, so hey, even better!  anyways, the game  has a website at: http://www.devilwhiskey.com go check it out if you like.  I'm tired now, it's a bit late. I'll start posting a little more regularly, promise (things are certainly still busy in the gradschool front, but hey, it'll be better soon).  Phil.",36
"Just for Brian -  Whoop Donkey.  I got a job. Yup, that's right. Neato, I'm employed!  So the big question is, do I stay in grad school? The answer - sorta. I dropped my daytime class (which I really really hated) and I'm keeping my nighttime course, which I only kinda hate.  Over the summer I will be doing nothing but working at my job and on that game, and then during the Fall semester I'll take another nighttime course. we'll see what happens from there.  Some might say ""there are only 3 weeks left in teh semster, why would you drop the course?"" to which I say ""cause it sucks"".  I wasn't doing so well as it was, but it was just getting to be ridiculous.  How about some homework, some tests, and some massive programming projects still left in the semester for BOTH my classes.  OS2's projects are immense, and frankly, I got better ways to use my time now. :D  So for those who care to know more, I'll be working at a place here in stillwater called ""SST Software"". they do GIS systems for agriculture.  I'll be learning to write .NET applications, which I have mixed emotions about, but I""ll be doing it for a good salary, of which the only emotion I have is elation :).  Anyways, I hope everyone else who is unemployed gets to go back into the workforce. My only problem now is whether or not I'm still qualified to watch the cartoons at oddtodd.com  Out.",36
"Hello and welcome back.  Well, I've completed my first 2 days on the job, seems OK so far. I think I'm still catching a bit of ""the new guy"" cold shoulder from folks, but things were warmer on my second day as opposed to my first. I'm starting to get into the swing of things there.  Tomorrow will be an adventure, I get to work all day and then go to a 3 hour night class. We'll see if I survive or not.  So I realized this weekend that I am one busy sombitch, check it - I have like 4 jobs! First there's the new one - the full time bit at SST, then I have my TA responsibilities, and while that has been scaled down *significantly* from what it was, I still am grading papers and holding one office hour per week. The third is only an hour or two a week, but a responsibility to meet nonetheless, I'm tutoring a person in CS 1 / java programming so they can go to grad school at cornell and have a leg up on the program there.  Finally, i'm still doing the game dev thing, which rocks by the way, and I really hope something more could come of that.  Heck, maybe our game wil be a hit, and they can afford to hire some full timers, like me ;).  So anyways, add them up, that's 4 jobs.  plus a night course for grad school, plus family commitments, ACM presidency, 2 dogs, and a new gamecube (heh).    Man, I can't wait for the semester to end, that'll help bunches. Think I'll leave this one short, it's late and this old working stiff needs to go to bed so he can get up at a decent hour tomorrow.  Later. Phil.",36
"Holy Crap.  The air conditioning in our office at SST is apparently broken for the one single room that I happen to work in (we're upstairs and have a seperate air conditioner from the rest of the folks.  it's gotten as hot at 91 degrees F inside here today, and I'm about sick of it.  Having had a heatstroke this weekend, I'm kinda fearful of being in this heavy heat all damn day long, but so far, no problems.  Aside from that, my day has been dull.  Tired of a lot of things right now, wishing I could just go and curl up in a ball for a few days and come  out refreshed.  I realize that's not gonna happen, and such is life. Still sucks tho ;)  Our 2 dogs got out of the yard this morning, and we got another ticket for Dog at large (2nd time this has happened since we lived here, first time was like september last year).  Pretty annoying when you just did a lot of work on a fence and they still break out.. fixing that fence was what gave me the heatstroke in the first place. Bastards.  I'm thinking I may leave work a bit early today, with all the heat it's hard to think about much of anything, and I've had enough shit on my mind lately that's kept me from being able to focus as it is.  Mostly money stuff, you know how that old rot can be.  I'm thinking about writing a few programs and selling them on eBay, maybe a movie collecting program that I'm writing for myself, and perhaps I'll do that budgeting program for my church that dad wanted.  The game is still going strong btw, we should hopefully be finished with the public demo at the end of this month (July) or the VERY beginning of August  the site is still at  urlLink www.devilwhiskey.com  if you missed the link before now.  Good stuff, and we've come a long way with it.  Hope those of you who are reading this will enjoy.  Oh, and if you see me around, make me enroll in a grad course NOW. I haven't enrolled yet, and I'm realizing that I really should.  Phil.",36
"urlLink Google Search:  Just got the new google 2.0 toolbar beta at work, thought I'd check it out. Kinda neat, it lets you add to Blogger at any time by clicking a button on the toolbar while surfing, blocks popups (dont' have to install mozilla at work anymore) and lets you search google immediately (being the google toolbar of course. )  Neato  Maybe now I'll actually update this page a bit more frequently.",36
"Thankfuly, our Air conditioning got fixed on Friday last week. That helped a lot. Having all kinds of fun at work with Web Services.   That part was serious. Internet Explorer is the best browser for my site there.   That part was NOT serious.  We require our users to use Internet Explorer.  Being an admittedly big-time mozilla firebird (formerly phoenix) fan-boy, I was kinda ticked about that.  I was even more ticked when I found out how crappy IE can be to develop websites for. Since we're using ASP.NET, we are really pretty much stuck with IE as a client browser, since Microsoft's Technologies tend to play best when they play together.  Unfortunately, MS's bastard child of a web browser doesn't play well with Cascading Style Sheets or PNG image files (you know, the standard way to format web pages, and the recommended Web Image format - according to the W3C).  CSS is horribly nasty in IE - but PNG is even worse.  See there's this thing called an alpha channel.  an alpha channel lets you determine how  transparent  or  opaque  an image is.  PNG's lets you specify it on a per pixel level, with varying levels of transparency across the image.   The only comparable popular graphic format we have on the web is GIF.  GIF's have only recently come out of a problem with the compression algorithm patent, which was a concern before.  But on top of that, the format is WAAY too dated.  You're limited to 256 colors, and the alpha support is really nothing more than an on/off switch for transparency - as in all or none.  So hey, PNG overcomes all those limitations, and they render great in every modern web browser, on every platform. Except for Internet Explorer on windows.  ya.  sucks...  even IE for Apple can render them properly.  Just not, you know, the biggest audience with the largest market share.  It can't quite do it.  So what's a web dev to do?   Hack it up. Seems there's a workaround using some direct X image style filter that ONLY works with IE, and isn't a real clean workaround.  But at least it does something  Sad sad day, that I'd be bitching about web design :(  on another note - the Game development is doing well, we're supposed to go code freeze for demo this weekend, we'll see if that happens.  I only really have one thing to work out now,  one last bard song implemenation.   We'll see if I can swing it in time or not..  I got 2.5 done this evening, even with changing the tire on my wife's car, and driving around town for a bit after I got off work to show her some places she's trying to scout out for employment.  This last bard song is a bit more complex than the others that I've done, but I shouldn't have much problem getting it done given an entire afternoon.  I'll post more details about everything once I get some more free time.  Phil.",36
"Oh Fortune how you mock me. Now the air-conditioning in my home is messed up. We have 2 window units - the one in our living room (that also gets the kitchen, bathroom, and hallway) is blowing warm air. The one in our bedroom still works OK, but it' pretty much does the bedroom only, and doesn't help much.  Time to call the landlord again.  Sad thing is we had it recharged like a week ago.  may be time for a new unit (yay).  I'd love it if she just put in central air, that'd make me smile, but I think there's about as much chance of that happening as there is a chance of me becoming a millionaire.  In which case I wouldn't be renting this little house anyways ;)  So the game dev is VERY near completion, we hoped to have code complete this weekend, doesn't look like that will happen, but demo-level code is complete on my end at least until the lead programmer gets his stuff in, and then I'll be able to finish off my last bit of demo-flagged code (hopefully that'll happen tonight).  I still have more stuff to finish before the game is done, but it's definitely the end now.  If what's left on my plate is all that's left, then I think I can finish it before school starts - which would be good since I won't have much time once school hits.  Oh - father-in-law may have hooked me up with a new contract now too.  Some company that needs a database mgmt system to track their inventory or something.  Apparently they've been managing the whole thing with a spreadsheet so far, and it's getting to be too big (HAHA, imagine that!)  so sounds like a simple database insert/update/delete form is all that is needed.  Heck, if they have access, and it's only one user, I won't even bother to make a full program, just do it with Access forms in an afternoon ;)  They were paying a PC tech like $300 to install/setup a PC so they must not be too scared to pay for their tech. This makes me smile.  might make a decent wage off of this one.  later all Phil.",36
"Wow.    Things kinda suck right now. But they're hella better than they were.  I have been the epitome of busy, tired and angry over the last couple of weeks, and it's really starting to show.  I hate it when things get like this, but the whole summer has pretty much sucked ass.  I know the people I work with have gotta think I'm one unlucky mother, and I hate to say it, but if you'd just been looking at my life since may of last year, you'd be right.  Here's a quick rundown of just a brief selection of the things I've had to deal with in the last 3 months. 1) Wife's car - broke down 2 times - once for the power steering pressure hose, and most recently (as in 2 days ago) the alternator went out 2) My car - broke down 2 times also - once was the heater core, second was the battery( 1 day ago).     for about 2 hours there, we had  0 drivable vehicles... now that sucked. 3)  Wife got laid off from her job at end of June  -   just recently started working again - still waiting on that first paycheck. 4)  After Shanna got laid off, we've visited the doctor or the hospital about 6 times.  the medical bills are really starting to pile up. 5)  Shanna had to have an emergency root canal on an abcessed tooth - no dental insurance (job's dental is pretty much worthless) 6)  Auto Insurance company who can't figure out how to properly charge a credit (debit actually) card and charge me twice what i actually owed. 7)  lack of funds in a big way.  With Shanna losing her job, me just starting one (that only pays once/month no less), all the doctor bills and car repairs... we're just barely squeezing by.   Shanna got a partial paycheck today, that is not enough to cover our next bill.   how we'll get past it until the end of the month is my current worry, and lord knows I have enough of that at the moment 8) Shanna's mom died 9) My grandfather (maternal) died. 10)  My sister (whose recent marriage was a highlight in this summer) is having trouble finding work - with a BS and a GPA of 3.98 to show for it too) 11) Game development is still going OK, but we're having trouble getting the last bits cleaned up.. some team members fell on some extraordinarily rough times, and that is causing troubles getting some content finished up. 12) I have trouble sleeping lately  (wonder why) 13) Loosing too much weight from the sleeplessness and the stress. 14) my dogs have fleas, and no medicated shampoo or flea collar seems to be helping the poor bastards.  Ick. Like the old quote goes tho, leave them with a great ending, and they'll feel like they had a good time (para.)  so here's the good things I've got going on: 1) still married 2) I'm employed - even if it's not my first pick, the job is getting better, and it's a good income 3) I'm working on a video game - and they finally got my name up in the credits.. now that's fucking cool no matter how you look at it. 4) even with all this I'm still managing to go to graduate school - class starts tomorrow for me (once/week) 5) my dogs are still fun and cute when they're not itching 6) my cars work now. and I was able to do most of those repairs myself, saved cash that way. (didnt' do the power steering hose, not enough time) 7) Shanna's got work now, and that's helping her out immensely 8) it's my birthday on Sunday, I'll turn 25, and my insurance rates will go down quite a bit, YAY.  there we go, so it's not all bad, but it's enough bad to have me pissed off, which, if you've been reading this long enough, you know can be entertaining in and of itself.  Phil out.  p.s. - www.devilwhiskey.com - we've been updating a bit lately.",36
"Well alright party people. I made it til payday :D one thing down, 700 more to go.  I'm certainly in a better mood now, still haven't gotten much sleep, but that's OK, it's a holiday weekend! so here's how things have been lately -  did my first deployment to our public webserver, until now I've mainly worked up internal apps for us, you know, stuff to help us manage our business more effectively. It helps the company to better streamline their workflow. In a slightly more common tongue - my apps have helped us get our work done quicker and easier.  However, I've finally gotten to put something out to our members only website - in other words, for subscribers only, but still, people other than employees are getting to see some of my work.   Have put out 2 things - 1) a new menu written in Javascript instead of the hairy VBScript one we had that included 12 asp files on every page just to generate the menu (decrease load time substantially I'd say) - and 2)  a new mapping page that is totally frickin awesome - and has consumed my worklife every day for about 3 weeks now, with only occasional breaks to maintain other stuff.  its' neato , you go to the menu, pick out a client, one of their farms, and one of their fields (from a pop up javascript dialog box, with data generated on the fly) - and then tell it to ""go"" - it then calls a webservice that takes in those inputs, goes and finds all the data we have related to that field - each set of data called a theme - each theme has a legend and a map associated with it - and each field has from 1 - 40 themes.  so my webservice takes the field, finds all the data, and DYNAMICALLY CREATES LEGENDS AND MAPS from it.  frickin cool stuff.  it's not just grabbing predefined images, but actually creating them.  I'm creating all the images as PNG's, and that way I can have a variable amount of transparency/opacity for each map image - meaning that when you stack all the differnent theme maps up together, you can actually see through them to the others.  As if that wasnt' enough - I also call another webservice from my webservice, to download aerial imagery and topographical maps from  urlLink  TerraServer  which I then scale, trim, and place behind my maps - so you can see that your Ph levels are low, becuase that field has a high spot, or because it runs next to the road and gets a lot of crap dripped down on it when it rains.  The web page also lets you dynamically drag and drop the legends in order to change the way the maps stack - in real time with no posting back to the webserver. - oh, you also choose to turn the themes on and off on the fly as well - you could have all 30 turned on, or nothing, just click a checkbox next to the theme name. I'm quite proud :D  the Game dev is going well - the MIA developers have still not shown much oomph. Got one guy kinda back. Hasn't done much but complain so far, so we'll see how much good he does.  Still, even with that kind of setback, we're still kicking ass. CEO decided to slip the date a week.  I think we coulda done it, but I'm glad to get to enjoy my holiday weekend.  I think I finished the last major coding section of it tonight - we decided to add it in so that we could include all the skills for each class, and not just a demo-tagged subset. So our users will probably be able to transfer their saves to the new game without much problem, which is a goal I think we should shoot for.  Now that the codebase is done, we can focus on scripting hte plot events. - guess I get to learn python, cause that's what we're using there.  I fixed about 8 scripts earlier, just by reading through some ones we had that I knew worked, doesn't seem horrible, but I'd have to have to create them from scratch, as I'm still pretty lost on it.  I've chatted enough for now, time to get back to work.  Phil.",36
"HOT DAMN!!!!!  Looky where my game was mentioned:  urlLink Penny Arcade!   Das right. our last conservative estimate was around 6,000 downloads.  we know there are several mirrors out there that we cannot count download stats from.  If you haven't checked it out yet, you really should.  That is all Phil.",36
"urlLink Devil Whiskey   Demo is finally out you know you want it.  Go see what a bunch of individuals with no financial backing but what they'll scrape together themselves, can do in their spare time.",36
"wow, I haven't posted in a LOOOOONNNGGGGG time.  So, time for an update. The game's final release date was delayed from Oct 31st to Nov 30th. We're accepting preorders starting Nov 7th (3 days away AACK).  Justin, our lead dev and CEO,  has asked me to take over the administrative duties for the project, since he's going to be extremely busy at work for the next 3 weeks.  Poor guy is doing 16 hour days  7 days a week for awhile  - they're trying  to get everything spic and span for some large IEEE convention, so that they can assure themselves funding in the future.  So I'm gonna be HELLA busy over the next three weeks. School seems to be going OK, day job is going well, I got a nice raise that I'm finally getting to see now - fricking once/month paychecks ;).  Gonna be pretty busy with the day job followed by the game dev. - School program just got finished so now I freed up a bit more time.  Ordered a 20"" trinitron refurb, what I got wasn't a trinitron, and was messed up - colors bled on the edges, text was  fuzzy in the top left corner, gaving me a headache, so I'm RMAing it and trying again.  Chris Berry up here at work ordered similarly, and got a nice monitor apparently so I don't feel too bad about it.  the 21"" is nice even with the slightly off display, I love having 3 coding windows up at once, and it makes the virtual desktops in linux that much cooler ;).  Apparently Anil has a friend who'd like to buy my old 17"" on the cheap, and I'm more than happy to sell it once I get a decent monitor from surpluscomputers.  Speaking of Anil - just a little tip for all the foreign people reading this... Don't take pictures of airplanes in the US.  or near a US armory.  Anil is an amateur photographer (who does great work BTW) and was snapping some shots of some woods around here, not knowing our Armory was behind the trees.  Then he caught a picture of a plane taking off too.  Someone drove by and saw a dark-skinned man taking photographs and called the cops.  This was about a month and a half ago.  last week on Friday his wife was interrogated by the FBI and then yesterday the FBI came back again to interrogate him.  They asked him a lot of questions, they took a CD of the pictures he'd taken, and amazingly enough - the asked him if he was a Muslim.  Seems like I remember questioning someone on the basis of religion to be illegal, but maybe it's OK if you're asking them if they're a muslim, since that automatically makes them evil :|.  Anil is Hindi anyways, so he didn't give two craps.  From what I've noticed he doesn't seem to care for the Muslim's a whole lot anyways ;).  In India the 3 main religions are Hindi, Islam, and Christianity, and apparently they don't mix real well at times.  Anyways, I really wanted to put up something, felt kinda like I was letting the blog slide too long.  So now I've posted for the few of you who may one day read this in a fit of boredom.  Enjoy.  Phil.",36
"After another nice long pause between posts I'm back. So lets recap what's gone on since the last post.  Game went out Dec 1st, and we sold several copies. Lots of bugs to stomp and such, and while I wish the initial release was cleaner, I'm pretty proud at my ability to keep up with the onslaught. We have a really great community of players, and their infinite patience is something I apprecaite.  I really think we filled a void with Devil Whiskey, as that new bard's tale game - once the hope of many - turns out to be a clone of Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance, but with a smarmy bard full of 2-bit humor.  Thus Devil Whiskey is really the only outlet for those who want to play the old style CRPGs, but with a new story, better music and graphics.  It's not selling quite as well as I had hoped, but it is selling none-the-less, and I have a sticky feeling that there are a LOT of peopel waiting for a few patches to come out before they'll buy it.  We're also working up some content expansions over the next few weeks, give them some neato stuff to play through, more interesting levels in my book, as they're all self-contained, and arent' being used to further plot - so they can all have nifty interesting stories, riddles, etc.  I'm still continuing to work at SST, and I enjoy it more all the time. Getting into some really fun problems to solve now, a bit more challening. Also, now that I have several apps out there, I'm getting busier with the rest of the business, fixing problems for them, expanding feature-sets and all that.  Good stuff, feel a lot more useful there now.  Finally, the big cool new news - I'm about to buy a home.  My cousin Shawn has a contract to sell a house for someone, and it's a pretty smooth deal.  They need to dump the mortgage ASAP, so it provides us a good oppurtunity to buy it underneath the appraisal value.  We'll end up bagging about 10% equity on the deal, which is great in my mind.  Only thing standing in our way is the lack of a strong account balance for the past few months. Mom and Dad sent me the rest of the cash they were paying me for my back-log of grad-school expenses, and that's plenty to have in the bank for the mortgage company, but it's simply a matter of how long it's been there, they want to see it there for teh last few months. Which it hasnt' been.  I've been tossing out a lot of cash on paying down debt, and Shanna's really only just started working a steady job again, which is the majority of our extra cash, so for about the last month or so, between her earnings, and the game royalties, our financial situation improved ten-fold.  Now getting the house and dealing with the rental lease is my main worry, and will hopefully all be settled soon.",36
"Well, it's been a few MONTHS since I've said anything...  and what a few months it has. another recap: 1) Not buying a home.. more on that later - I'm prety angry that it didn't happen, and yet glad it didn't in a way. 2) SST still going strong, I'm a dev lead on a new project that i'm really liking. I'm enjoying getting out of pure-codemonkey status, and getting into system design in addition to coding. 3) Oh ya - I'm divorced now - thus topic 1 :)  So ya, single FyL is back on the scene, mothers lock up your daughters.  Or don't, if they're old enough for me, they probably don't live there anymore anyways, and I'm not exactly the ""grab the first 18 year old you see, cause she thinks your cool cause you can buy beer"" type anyways :)  Why'd I get a divorce? If you want to know, I've probably already told you, if not - well sorry, ask me sometime.  When did I get a divorce ? we split up about 5 days after that last post (Jan 10) and were official divorced at some point in February (18th I believe).  So where am I at now?  Same geographical location.  New truck though! yay!  Explorer was about done for, so I traded it in and got myself a 2000 Ford F150, my first Full-Size truck ever.  Used to have an S10 in high school, but it had certainly been awhile, definitely liking a car I can actually fit in comfortably, gotta give thanks for that.  Well, it's late, I'm tired, and no one reads this thing but me, and maybe Brian or Kaleb.  Hi guys if you're there. If you're not, I hate you suck.  or something. I dunno  Anyways, I hope this message finds everyone happy, healthy, and a bit wiser from the days experiences.

"I'm trying to keep up with my typical post-once-every-three months schedule - so far I'm right on track ;)    Well, lets see - what all neato new things are going on in my life.  As per usual - the small stuff first:       Finished with Devil Whiskey - it was mucho fun, and I really enjoyed my time there - but the contract has been completed, and I just really don't have enough time to continue on there. The game is still selling well, and the europeans are pouncing on it whenever a magazine article comes out in their country.     Still at SST - still kicking ass there - things are getting tight - we have a seasonal release schedule (being ag based) so this time of year finds us pushing to get all the new stuff done to be ready for fall planning.     Almost done with the Shanna payments - ready for that to be over and done - close that chapter of my life. Got back the Honda she had - she never arranged for new financing so I have to sell it to pay off the lien - there was some mechanical stuff wrong with it that needs fixing first so I'm gonna be trying hard to break even on the deal. Honda's have great resell value, but tossing 60k miles on car in a year will hurt you no matter what kind of car it is.    So that's all the typical here's my life right now news and then the biggie (like you probably don't know or can't guess):    I've met an amazing girl     Her name is Jennifer, she lives here in Stillwater. She's about to finish her M.S. in Psychology, and will be pursuing her PhD shortly thereafter. Very intelligent, kind, and interesting woman. She rocks my frickin socks off and that's that. If you need to know more, you can probably find me easily enough otherwise, I'll catch up with ya later in another three months when I'm halfway through next semester's courses (which will suck).      Anyways, that's enough info for now, see ya soon.",36
"Upsie Daisy, Downsie Daisy   Sometimes life's good.  Sometimes life's bad.  And sometimes I feel queasy, because I really can't tell if things are going up or down -- I know it's definitely motile, even if it's just resonating back and forth.  I recently came upon  urlLink Tinka's blog , and found myself.  It felt like looking through a mirror!  How exact are her words, in describing how I'm feeling?  All her uncertainties, frustration, her endurance and her yield of control -- I don't know what it is, but her blog seems to say all the things that I am afraid to admit in my own blog.  It's kind of spooky, actually -- it felt like some sort of alter-ego voice telling me that I need to be more honest with myself.   I'm feeling a bit low these days, obviously because of the gargantuan amount of work that I do.  Had it been something more meaningful, like something to give me experience in my future career, or like saving the world, I would not be this stressed and unhappy.  There.  I said it.  I'm unhappy.  Many things are not going right, and I've been putting up with them silently.  I've been bitching and moaning on my blog for sure, but I was in denial.  I am unhappy, and now I admit it.   While I certainly do feel ready for a relationship, sometimes I doubt myself.  I am conflicted.  There's a conflict of interest.  Am I wanting to get into a relationship because I truly seek my other half (or temporary space-filler, at the least) or because I'm just really really lonely and utterly lost?  It's one of those things I ask myself frequently.  If I were dating a man (hypothetically speaking -- long term), and he proposed, what would I say?  My biggest fear would be that I would say yes.  Normally, that would be a cause for celebration, but underneath the very bottom layer of my heart, I would be questioning myself.  Am I marrying this man, because I truly love him, or am I marrying to get myself out of this horrid situation (a.k.a. ""go fuck yourself USCIS!"")?   Perhaps that is the reason for my growing ill-sentiment for marriage.  It is one of my greatest fears, to be lying to myself.  But sometimes, it's not as simple as thinking things over a night of sleep.  How can I admit that I am only seeking a relationship because of sheer, utter loneliness, when I really don't know?  How would I know if I am truly ready for such human bonding?   I always want to bust out of this ""it pays the bills"" job and do the things I really want to do -- I was meant to do.  But I don't know what it is!  It's the most difficult thing.  For a good 10 years, all I ever wanted to do was become a doctor.  Become an MD, and work in third-world countries.  Fight AIDS.  When I get too feeble and old to work under harsh conditions, I will come back and teach, to install the same passion for humanitarianism to the younger generations.  For 10 years, that was what I wanted to do!  But a second passes by.  60 of those are a minute, and then 60 of those are an hour, and 24 of those are a day, and years passed by.  Now I am turning 24 (again with the age thing!), frightened out of my mind!  I am getting older each year, without becoming any wiser.  The clock is ticking, and I still don't know where I'm going.   This whole ""going to medical school"" business was as good as set in stone for me.  I could not imagine myself doing anything else.  It was my ""calling.""  I was so happy to have found my ""calling"" because I know so many people who wander aimlessly, just doing what feels ""ok"" -- not even what feels ""right"" -- and wasting their precious time on this planet -- people, we get, at the most, about a century, and that's if we're lucky.  It would be nice if we could live until we were 600 years old like Moses, but apparently, that's not too commonplace these days!  Also, it seems that nothing is ""set in stone"" unless it literally is.   My dreams of medical school flopped.  Now I have drifted away from the sciences and math.  If I ever get my bachelor's degree, I would be in my late 20's.  Would I ever make it to medical school?  I am not so sure -- I have lost faith in my greymatter.  I can no longer recite page after page from memory for the sheer joy of shocking my classmates.  Heck, I can barely stay awake through a paragraph.  And I also have more fun reading for English classes, rather than biology texts.   So now that my life-long planning has flopped, where to, and how?  Would I be as passionately motivated?  So many quesitons, so little answers.  I used to be one smart kid.  Now I'm an astonishingly average, mediocre young adult, and pretty soon, I'll be   old   and the twinkle in my eyes will have dulled to a mirky brown color, reflecting the muddiness of my capabilities as a human being.  How can I have a relationship when I'm so uncertain?  I don't know whether I'm coming or going.  How can I break loose from the hells of a cell phone store, when I really have no clue if there's something better out there?   Speaking of outrageous fears... I know I'm digressing again, but somehow, I feel like this is the time to write it out.   Every child has fears.  Most have fears of the boogey man, vampires, monsters.  Fortunately, no monsters hid under my bed to devour me the moment my parents went to bed and the lights were off.  I feared no monster, no ghost, no werewolves.  I feared murderers who escaped from prison.  I feared psychopathic child-molesters.  I feared rapists, at an age when I did not know what rape was.   When I grow up, and make a whole lotta money, I need to go plop down on a psychiatrist's couch and start my much-needed, years of therapy.   I won't go into details, but at that tender, sweet age (ok, so I don't remember the exact age) of seven or so, I was wronged.  I don't know what the word would be to describe it.  It wasn't rape.  Sexual assault?  Can you sexually assault a 7-year-old who doesn't know what sex is?  If a man grabbed your child-self and threatened with a sharp blade in the middle of the night, and you don't remember it for the next 6 years, did it still happen?  Sometimes I ask myself if I am imagining things, because sometimes I do.  I imagine bad things, to see if they seem real enough -- it's my personal gage to measure whether or not a certain bad misfortune could happen to me.  Like becoming paralyzed in a car crash.  I try to imagine that happening to me, but I can't make it feel real.  So in some mystical, internal way, I tell myself that it won't happen to me.  I try to imagine myself leaving the US, never to return.  No matter how hard I try, I can't make that image become alive.  So I tell myself, if I can't even imagine it, it won't happen.  But can I see myself with a man, not even a man, a boy, just twice my age of seven, to do things to me that I can't even write, let alone say?  Too often, I see myself in the same predicament, and the story plays out exactly the same, every time.   Oh yes, the pain.  The years of suffering.  Not really.  I'm a tough cookie, as  urlLink Christopher  says.  I don't want to become the next basket case woman who cried wolf.  Even I read magazine articles of women, who had been date-raped and what-not, and roll my eyes, and say to myself, ""not another one.""  Rape doesn't make you special.  Getting touched in your special place by Michael Jackson doesn't make you special.  I don't want to be Hellen Keller.  I don't my biography to say, ""despite all her misfortunes... blah blah blah.""   I'll tell you what my biggest misfortune is.  It is this curse.  That I have to write.  As I child, I read a story about a girl who bought a pair of red shoes although she was warned not to.  She puts on the red shoes and dances forever and ever, through thorny vines and all, and finally has to have her feet amputated and replaced by wooden pegs or something.  I'm hazy on the details, but you get the picture.  I'm the girl who has to write and write and write and write, to no avail.  On the surface it seems therapeutic, but the more I get into it, the more of my ugly self I see, and the devastation is just too gory for me to bear.   Yes.  I'm a nutcase.  I bask in the juices of my misery, smothered in the gross tar pit of my own despair.",37
"T H U M P. . . THUMP. . THUMP. . thump, thththththththththth... The beating of my heart at a speed of 200-beats-per-minute woke me -- it thumped so hard that there was pain.  When my eyes adjusted to the brightness around me, I knew I was free, at least temporarily. When will it stop?  These nightmares -- the brutal killings, sinister villains, and my own impotent measures for escape -- come more frequently than ever.  Even as a child I was never one to cry awake in the middle of the night from a bad dream.  In fact, I was such a sound sleeper, I barely even remembered some dreams, and those that I remembered were just  gae-ggoom , a dog-dream, which means a dream that has no meaning.   Now an adult, I wake up because my own piercing shrills awaken me from what shouldn't be called slumber.  The dilated blood vessels form red cracks in the whites of my eyes, and I am always left panting for air.  The moon floods the room with an iridescent light, and it is the witching hour.  There is momentary silence, a vacuum, if you will, until reality creeps in and I can adjust to it, and hear the chirping of crickets outdoor, and the neighbor's cat making love calls. Early this morning I had such a dream -- one that also left me out of breath from fright and one that made my eyelids slap open, like one of those blinds that roll up in cartoons when a little string is tugged.  I saw the red LED numbers on my alarm clock -- 08:00.  It was a dream.  But was it a dream?  When you try to explain a dream, the harder you try to make sense of it, the more confusing it becomes.  I can only say that mine was of terrorism.  Men in head-to-toe orange came in, ravaged women and beat the men, killing them in the most brutal fashion -- no, not kill -- as death would have been too merciful.  In my dream people lay with their eyes wide open, forced to watch the continuation of atrocities as they happen -- no solace would be granted.  I scream, but no sound is made -- I am in a vacuum.  I am in a vacuum because there are two conflicting positions -- if I scream, the terrorists would surely hurt me too -- if I don't scream... how can I not, when a man's skull was cracked open before my own eyes? Cruel eyes -- why must you see?  I want to shut them -- I want to be rid of this, but my lids won't come down, they just won't close -- I have to see.  I want to persuade, I want to yell out ""stop"" but my tongue is frozen solid, and so are my legs, firmly planted where I stood, in the middle of madness, midst of a frenzy that was an overload for my sensory nerves.  Too much to handle, and I'll break down.  I must do something, but I am paralyzed. They say that dreams reflect you, at an unconscious level -- maybe about someone you love, or happily eating mountains of carbs, or perhaps your fears.  It is only after the nightmare starts to fade that it becomes clear -- I am leading a life of paralysis.  I need to move, but I can't, because I am afraid to move, but I still need to move, and I still can't, and I am still afraid.  A vicious circle.  Paralyzed with fear.  The most cruel thing to do to yourself -- and yes, it is something I inflict on myself -- I am a victim of my own doings.   The nightmares come more frequently these nights.  I pull up the blankets, upto my nose, with trembling hands, preparing for another battle within.",37
"Los Angeles.  What can I say about the city of corruption, of filth, of savages?  Los Angeles has a reputation, a myth, a legend of sorts -- it is the land of endlessly sunny days, tall palm trees wading in the cool Pacific breeze.  People wear sunglasses and smile.  The perfect brochure to lure fools searching for gold.  Truth is, LA will swallow you whole, and you too, will join and be one with the sordid conditions of the city.   There are Republicans, and even more Democrats, and even more powerless victims.  Quarrels ensue in the name of a government for the the people and by the people, but in the end, everyone knows, the scapegoats are plain to see.  The deserving poor, the ones not speaking the language, the ones with different colored skin, the ones who don't have houses on the beach.  Cut public education.  Cut the arts and music.  Kill the animals at the shelter, ASAP.  Don't give them a chance to be found!   The blaming game continues.  Who mishandled what budget and what movie star governor is definitely not terminating his staff, and in fact, increasing their pay.  Fingers are pointed, but nothing gets accomplished.  A seemingly civilized witch hunt for everything.  Outwardly civil, inwardly evil. You'd think of bronzed gods and buxom beauties, strutting down the streets in a lux saunter, flashing pearly white teeth, waving as though they were on a pageant.  Instead, the truth is that toothless and homeless dwell, covered in insane amounts of dirt and dust, overlooked unless they scare you with the flashing of the whites of their eyes.   Restaurants proudly display a letter grade of ""A"" on their windows, a grade lower and even baser than the scarlet letter, because it is bought not earned.  Back alleys are crowded with roach colonies, some big as mice.  You can hear them run when you turn on the lights, their hairy legs brushing against the darkness, stealthily.",37
"The advertising agency I work for is housed in a hundred year old textile mill. The mill was reclaimed years ago and refashioned into a business incubator, which is exactly what its name implies; most of the businesses here are young, cash poor and hungry. They are all courting venture capital, or awaiting that magical relationship with Microsoft or General Motors that will make all five employees rich beyond the dreams of avarice and send them to tan on a golden beach somewhere. But these dreams for almost all of us are just that -- dreams. We stay affloat and do our best to keep moving ahead. We take good fortune in the little trickles it chooses to show itself in, and we hope that the next day will find the phone full of voicemails with work offers. In my boss's mind, we've made it. The yard stick by which she measures out success is the two full time employees and one cash-cow account we have to our claim. That second full time employee is a new hire, and his recent arrival has meant a smorgasbord of vacation time for that same boss. Our apparent competence, coupled with her restlessness, has meant a lot of screw ups and tense moments over the last ten weeks. Unnanounced days off. Lengthy mornings off. This has also thrust one tired twenty-five year old, on more than one occasion, into the flight seat of an advertising agency overseeing one hundred and fifteen thousand dollars worth of ad dollars per month. And he is me. And he is leaving.  When I was very small my sister lived in Washington, DC. We would go visit her frequently and stay in her craftsman style house in Chevy Chase, MD with her roomates whose names and faces time has seen fit to erase from my memory. What was never erased, though, was the feeling of being in DC -- the feeling that there was a whole world out there beyong the sloped front yard and cramped confines of my parents suburban home. When she moved back to our home town, it would be years before I would go back. A short trip with my dad and brother rekindled the flame. After that I spent several weekends there, drinking it in in huge gulps and taking ten dozen cameras full of pictures. It was around the time that my ex and I started hanging out with the hellyeah kids that I decided it would be the perfect place to live full time. She and I never talked with any certainty about doing it. It was always more of a fantasy we'd engage in, or something we'd talk about when the rent was late and we wished to be anywhere but the small town we lived in.  But now, as both my experience and my duties have begun to pile up (and my level of frustration at the lack of any sort of structure here) I am really leaving. And I didn't even know it until I met S.  I'm not inclined to be very sentimental, or put much stock in odd coincidences. But within the first twenty minutes I knew S, we mentioned DC. Not as some vacation spot or a nice place to get sushi, but as a  destination . Her talk of moving as we got to know each other became a constant. It pushed me to look inside and ask myself why I had dragged my feet so long about moving. When I realized I might be falling for her, I ran out of reasons. So here I am looking through job listings she's printed for me, or talking to someone who knows someone who might get me work. And the pieces are all clicking, Loudly. This is really happening.",38
"This blog is about my job, my search for a new one, and my inevitable move to Washington, DC to seek my fame and fortune. I know they're up there somewhere.",38
"This is definitely going to be the little brother of  urlLink solitaryseventy-eight . Here, I can talk about things that are more personal. i know that keeping a blog is really about being okay with telling all, but I'm just not.",38
First post!,38
"I just came back to this after a few months of forgetting it was even here. I've been working so hard on my own content management system that I just forgot to do things like update this. Or sleep. Or eat things that weren't in cardboard pouches. I guess I've forgotten a lot of things, many of which were of extreme paramount importance. Others I'm okay with. So, I think I'll use this as a photolog when I get my  urlLink new camera . Or should I get the  urlLink guitar  first?",38
"S is upstairs. Right now. Asleep in my bed. I am here, in the living room. Updating this thing. This is because, as far as she knows, I'm not sleepy. This is only partly true. The actual truth is closer to my own increasing confusion about exactly what is happening between us.  Here's what happens. We hold. We touch. Anything beyond that seems tolerated, but not exactly enjoyed. Perhaps that's a bit harsh. But it's the way I feel. I can't say anything, though. I'm sure if I did it would be sort of a problem. So I just do the best I can with what I have. Which, granted, is a lot. I mean, should my own inability to understand the finer points of asexual platonic sleeping be grounds to doubt any possibility of this relationship mutating into something else? Probably not. And yet, I find myself feeling a little frustrated with things every now and again.  This is wrong, I know. This is selfish and stupid and childish. Still, I can't beat back the feeling. It's there sometimes. Part of me wants to kiss her. But I stop there. I think after several years of upheaval in terms of my sexual role with L I'm ready to set it down for a while. But still it's nice to feel attractive, and not just like an object of comfort or protection or a guard against loneliness. Too harsh again, perhaps. But I still can't help it.  Tonight we happened upon a rock show in a very unique venue downtown. In an ancient junk shop there is a stage and a PA, and some friends of friends are playing music. S and I go at the behest of a figure from her not too distant past. So I ended up making a new friend and seeing a band I had wanted to see for some time. The seats in the place are old couches and livingroom chairs from the Eisenhower administration. Midway through the second bands set, S slides her foot underneath my knee. I wanted to let it kill me, but it didn't faze me at all. That's sad because I want to be attracted to her and have it reciprocated, and I want to have that secret feeling in the pit of my stomach that signals nervousness and desire. Maybe I outgrew it? Maybe it feels pointless?  Maybe I'm jumping the gun on all this. Maybe these things will come with time. Who knows. I want to see where it goes, because I value S -- her opinions and her time. I am jumping the gun right?",38
"I was so exhausted yesterday after another night of drifting in and out in S's bed. I don't know what it is about it, but so often I just can't sleep there. I still think it's a function of being too warm.  I snuck out for a nap during lunchtime, and felt much better when I got back to work. I drove to a client's and did a short pitch for a website that went very well, and I think my budget will go through with little or no changes. After work, I came home and almost immediately launched into a workout. I tried a few new exercises -- I can really feel the weighted side bends today -- and wasted an hour or so playing guitar and messing with Garageband. I had left S a message, wondering after her job status. Sometime later she called and asked if I'd like company. I did, of course, want company.  I should tell you that I am very self-concious about my apartment. I'm not messy, but I just don't own much stuff. I've spent the first few years of independant life amassing all the techie goodies and musical toys I always wanted, and haven't really worried much about furniture. I do have nice table settings though. This would mark only the third time S had been into the house -- and only the second time that the visit would last more than a minute or two. I gave her a very brief tour the first time, and the second time we were confined mainly to the living room watching The Office on DVD.  On the phone she asked what would happen were she to be rendered too exhausted to drive home? I replied something faux-witty about having something called a bed.   I spent most of the evening trying to keep my distance, since I'd managed to make it all evening without a post-workout shower. I brought her my Powerbook so that she could check her email, and she proceeded to raid my home directory and go through my photo archives. At one point, with just the tiniest note of emotion in her voice, she said to something along the lines of, ""you really loved her..."" She meant L, my ex and former live-in. I replied that I did, but that my romantic love for L left, along with my couch, long ago. S seemed encouraged by what she deemed my ""capacity for love."" She lamented the fact that so many people seem to not have such a thing. I only wish she knew the half of it. I fall in love so easily it's ridiculous.  After a shower for me, it was time for bed. Not awkward. Not weird. Just bed. S seemed to feel as though I was anticipating something. I genuinely wasn't, and was only looking forward to a decent nights sleep and maybe an arm around me. After popping a melatonin I drifted off and slept through the night without incident. Obviously, even if I wanted to, I couldn't remember the exact timeline of the evening after climbing into bed. Some things stay, though. The last emotion I remember having very clearly was the slightest twinge of something. It wasn't anger. It was just a need for some explanation of exactly what it was we were doing. It passed wordlessly. Drifting off, S said to me,  ""You like rules."" I smiled, made a puzzled expression for the benefit of the darkness and the nape of her neck. ""No I don't,"" I chuckled. ""No?"" ""No. I have a rule: no rules.""  She's playing at not wanting to put things in boxes again. I'm already asleep.",38
"S started a blog of her own. She really is quite a writer. She also saw my blog, which has provided hours of awkward exchanges. Fun. So, since no one but me and people who might stumble upon it even know it's here, I'm going to start using this blog to say all those secret things that dare not speak their names in more polite circles.   S and I are both bound for Washington, DC someday. As she often reminds me, she will probably be there long before me. Though I don't want to believe this, I have to accept it; I just signed off on a salaried position that I can't very well just walk away from mere weeks after taking it. There are also the niggling money woes that still dog me, and my lame car. All the rest, like my debilitating fear of certain kinds of travel inherited from certain members of my family, are no longer issues. And the recent application (and likely acceptance to) a job in the greater DC area will likely give S a dramatic head start towards northern Virginia.  The time we spend together lately is blissfully strange, and more often than not I wake up in her room with squares and triangles of sunlight recreating the works of Kandinski on the wall behind the head of the bed. Sometimes I know I'm a warm body; other times I could swear there's something more than some intricate and bizarre friendship at play. I woke up several nights ago and rolled over away from her, only to have her call me back and throw her arm around me. It's sad to be 25 years old and experience that and have the momentary feeling that you could finally die happy. But that's the hand that my life has dealt me, so I can't beat myself up about it. Last time I was there, she was worried about the mess she had got herself into, chartering last minute flights to attend a round of job interviews. I crossed a line I had sworn to myself I would not cross. I put my hands through her hair and -- rather easily -- began to try and comfort her. She made mention of the fact that it was working, and it felt wonderful. But there is still that underlying strangeness. The good news is that as time goes the relationship gets to be less and less strange and more solid and substantial.  In the background of all this I am trying not to notice my clothes getting a bit looser, and my face developing something that other humans call a  chin . Who knew. Once again, after a period that found me deriding him, I owe a great debt to Henry Rollins once again. And to my brothers W and A. I'm sure one knows it, and reasonably certain the other would never cop to it due to his unerring humility.",38
"Today, Augusten Burroughs is checking into rehab, the printer is having a meltdown with my art files, and I am looking for a new couch. I have also broken a long-standing date to go to the zoo and meet someone from YP that I had talked to earlier this Spring. I simply could not make myself go. I mean the print shop actually did have a meltdown, so I would have been late anyway. I just wasn't feeling any enthusiasm about it. Something tells me this is a little weird, because it was seeming like a lot of fun until this morning. I'm not going to bother reading in to all this. It wasn't even a date. It just felt...wrong? Wrongish, anyway, if not totally objectionable. I'm also still trying to figure out the phone call last night. I am failing at coming up with any solid theories. All I know is that I was upset that my friend was upset, and I felt myself wishing I could make it a little easier. Of course none of these things are required of me, so I felt a little silly. Finding my place in all this is a very engaging and enjoyable past time. It's the perfect thing to think about while you pick out sofas. So, here I go to do just that.",38
"I have been battling exhaustion for a few days now. I'm not sleeping well, and I'm tired of thinking I'm out of the woods financially only to have something new come up. I've tried really hard to get motivated about lifting, but it's proving to be very difficult; I start working and I fall asleep between sets on the bench. This really isn't helpful. I think all of this is pointing to a change of venue. I spoke to the owner of a company that offered me a job. I ultimately turned it down in favor of the newly-salaried job I currently have, but he could tell I was apprehensive about letting it go. I told him about my desire to move to the DC area, and he brightened up. He basically told me to name my field and he can find work for me. I told him money was an issue, and that I wouldn't take a pay cut. He was unfazed. So it looks as though the employment scene there might not be as tough to crack as I thought. He told me not to worry about degrees or credentials because, as he said, ""your portfolio speaks for itself."" I haven't told a soul any of this yet, but it makes me feel incredible to think that I might actually be able to network my way up to DC before I'm 26. It also doesn't hurt that I could be making $50k when I do it. Fuck, that looks snotty to read. But can I help it that I want to be comfortable and not struggle anymore? So today, while I try to make something out of the nothing that is the days job orders, I'm looking at Craig's List for places to rent. One of my other difficulties when moving will be trying to deal with my lousy credit, which has a way of making it difficult to rent anywhere. I've resigned myself to a bad credit score for some time, even though I am well on my way to crawling out from under the vast majority of the debt that I accrued when I was younger. Still, sharing a place with a room mate may not prove to be too weird, and I'll probably be spending the first year in the new place just finding my way around and having all kinds of crazy fun, merely using my apartment to sleep and nothing else. There's WiFi all over DC, so I could even work in restaurants and bars if I have to. I'm just prepared to  go ; I don't want to over think it and bellyache about where I'll stay or money or transportation. Of course I want somewhere to live and some way to get around. But I'm inspired by the ways my friends have found to set their sites on a new town and just pick up and go -- especially Reuben, who always manages to fly slightly by the seat of his pants and have fun doing it. I think if dreaming about something almost daily without any resolution (other than two day visits) for five years doesn't kill your desire for it, then it's meant to be. So this is the year to do it. S says this is my test. If I am to be tested then now's the time, because I'm finally ready.",38
"S left on her trip today, but not before calling me on my office doorway weirdness. Fuck. I don't know why I get the way I do. It's ridiculous I know. I just start feeling so...polite? Respectful? I dunno. It's weird. So yes, When Harry Met Sally has nothing on the weirdness that is this. Then, as I reviewed the playlist I made her for her trip for the eight-millionth time, I realized some of the lyrics are sort of innappropriate. Maybe that isn't the right word. I just don't want anyone getting any ideas. Unfortunately pop music really hasn't found a way to write a song about whatever this is so you sort of have to find what you can and make it fit. That's why it's so advantageous to be able to put twelve or so tracks on one CD; I can take something from here and something from there and make it all cohesive. Sort of. Plus it's just nice to give your friends good music to listen to on long trips, car or otherwise.  I hope I am not the only one who can see the ironic value in that Daft Punk song. I mean other than the Gap's advertising agency.  This concludes tonight's emotionally indirect blog post. Who am I afraid of? My Powerbook?",38
"Sometimes I know exactly what Pete Townsend was talking about, when all the confusion of feelings and friends and the past and the inevitable future are all in your midst.   Last night was pure summer 2003. D (my boss and one of my closest friends) had some of us over to grill out in the rain. We had fun, had lots of drinks. A good meal was had as well. As I was bedding down on the couch (which was exactly where I needed to be, I admit) S called. We embarked on a pretty lengthy conversation, that included her reading passages from a book on Feng Shui. What most people know about this subject would fill a thimble, and is usually limited to the correct way to point your bed. Apparently there's more to it than this, going so far as to include notions that we might associate more strongly with Western psychotherapy.  Feng Shui can even tell you where to put your baggage. Or at least how best to prepare it for travel. Without you. Into the garbage.  I moved into this house with someone else. It was  our  house. I hate it here now. It's not like home at all; it's more like a place to store things until something better comes along. I don't hate it because I miss her, or lament our failed relationship. I hate it here because it still contains a lot of things that she left me to clean up and do away with. In doing that she left me the emotional baggage of two people to sort through and make final decisions about. I have only realized this recently and it's taking me a little time to arrive at the inevitable conclusion that if she left it she doesn't want it, and it goes. I know resentment can eat you alive, and it isn't attractive. The same goes for bitterness. Part of me bristles at the thought of unpacking all this and throwing it away, only to have to repack all my things in a few months and move.  Last night S tells me, seemingly apropos of nothing but I was kind of tipsy, that she isn't waiting anymore. It didn't worry me then, but as today ages into its afternoon it's starting to make me ponder a bit.  S also enlightened me as to her own personal theories about some facets of my personality, and I have to say some of them were not so dead on. I told D this morning about being a day to day person, and that S was right in assuming that leaving high school to go build websites has rendered me someone with loads of experience but no papers. Against her better judgement, D said, she told me how I needn't worry about finding work elsewhere; that it would happen, and that I should be glad that college hadn't ""beaten the artist out of"" me. She also joked that she might even write a letter of recommendation for me. D is worried about my leaving, and she knows it will happen a lot sooner than she wants it to, or -- shamefully -- a lot sooner than I've let on. And it gets shorter everyday. In the last six months, I have changed more than I have in the previous nine years. I am strong, and happy, and finacially secure. These changes are for me, and were made by me. These are the changes that will facilitate my moving and starting a new life, one where the internal changes can mingle happily with the external ones.  That's the top secret plan. The one I never mention. I will move. I will make good money. I will come into my own and I will be living in  my  city -- not my familys --  mine . I think all sets of positive changes are precipitated by a walkabout. Yes baggage follows you -- but if you're in a new town where it doesn't know the streets or the buildings then maybe you can lose it, or make it scared and small enough to put in your pocket. And best of all I will be doing this in less than a year. Saying makes it feel better, and makes it real. But there are topics I haven't breached yet. They'll have to wait.",38
"Ok. Here it is.  I'm worried that I'm slipping into a depression and I don't know how to deal with it. I do not want to make it anyone else's problem by yammering about it. But at the same time I have no idea what triggered it (if anything; my depression doesn't usually work that way) or how long it may last. Today I've been trying to actively get past it with only limited success; I had a healthy breakfast and lifted weights first thing this morning. I was early to the first appointment of the day. I even worked dutifully from home when the office got unbearable. But I'm still sort of touchy and liable to take things the wrong way, and I generally feel kind of mopey. All last night I had horrible nightmares that jerked me awake several times. I kept waking up and watching S sleep peacefully, and finding things to worry about.  And it feels so horrible and awful. I haven't had a mood in five months, so I am totally unprepared to accept it. That's why I'm fighting it so hard, because I just want it  gone . It's just inopportune and unwelcome and I wish it wouldn't happen.  I keep wondering if I jinxed myself by putting too much stock into what she wrote on her blog about potential for a flame out. But I'm not flaming out about that, or anything in particular really. I just feel listless, and unable on some level to let my vacation slip into the rear view and get back to work. I haven't really said how amazing and relaxing all that was yet. It's worth mentioning how fantastic it was to be there with one of my best friends, not to mention S.  We had a moment on the beach that I think I will remember for the rest of my life, even if all this ends tomorrow. There were several other moments that will linger in my memory for a very long time, regardless of anything else that happens. I keep trying to think on those things, and all my other good fortune, to try and shake this -- but again with limited success.   So right now I'm off on a bike ride in hopes that a little more exercise will help the situation, since it has helped the most of all the things I've tried. A refill of Lamictal might help too. So, here goes nothing.",38
"To hear my father tell it, the face of the American South changed drastically with the advent of air conditioning -- and I don't doubt it for one minute. I try to picture movie theatres that are full nearly around the clock, and lunch counters peopled by the sweaty masses nursing ice waters. This is the south of my dad's generation. Now the subtle clunk of AC compressors starting up is the soundtrack of daily life here in offices and homes. The heat finally killed the AC in our office this week though, so we're suffering and so is our attendance. The heat is almost a living thing, like a fourth employee who won't shut up and drinks all the coffee before you can have one single cup.  So it's a pleasure to have lunch with S and talk about the minutiae of our days, or swap family histories. Yesterday we rearranged our schedules and skipped lunch just so -- as she puts it -- I could watch her nap in my bed for twenty minutes. Yes, maybe that's a little funny. But all I know is that I have the inclination to do that sort of thing with her, but none of the ""craziness"" that has gone with it before; it just feels very normal and natural. I think the craziness we fear could also be called codepedance, depending on how up you are on psychology lingo. I think we could make a great team of some kind. Her ideas lately about selling my art have made me hopeful for a future where I can pursue fine art again, and flattered at her appreciation for my photography. But I also still marvel at our ability to live independant lives, and spend time apart if for no other reason than we want to. The relationship I am coming out of was all about codependance; we were rarely seperated and when we were it was out of necessity. We both hated it, but were powerless to stop. My greatest fear in any relationship is that I may lapse into it again, and I am greatly encouraged by knowing that it would have reared its head by now and it hasn't. I think there's definitely something here, and I'm trying to get over the superstition I have about talking about it. So I'm off to my favorite coffee shop to try and get some  urlLink work  done. Remind me to write a letter to GE for inventing this life changing thing called air conditioning.",38
"In polite conversation in the south, they call it 'the procedure.'   I think they probably call it that everywhere actually, unless you're discussing politics. Then it's okay to use the word 'abortion', since the word carries enough weight to almost be a political statement unto itself.  Anyway, that experience is a large part of why I got upset the other night when I undertook to clear out the first of several rooms in my house of my previous life. And in talking to my 'paid friend' today -- who is amazed at my progress, my forward momentum, my excitement at each new day -- she mentioned how easy it is for people to mistake your mourning for lost time or your bidding farewell to your previous self as mourning for something else. The fact is that I am so far removed from wanting to go back and change things that the thought never even occurs to me; I just look past all the junk and put the time and the person out of my head. The PF says this is common for males too. We are largely the ""out of site, out of mind"" sort, who tend to not notice when it comes to the leavings of an absent former partner. ""You may not notice when it's there, but you sure as hell will notice when it's not,"" she said, meaning the feeling of liberation is empowering. And I know it is after driving all those years of being a sucker and not caring about myself or my own feelings directly to the dumpster and tossing them in.  I also told her about my move, which gave her a huge smile and a speechless moment, considering I barely wanted to leave the house a year ago when I started therapy.  She seemed to think it was funny, though not altogether out of character, for me to stop drinking completely until I learn to call cabs. But whatever works.  On my monitor at work, there are two Chinese cookie fortunes. One says  ""There is a prospect of a thrilling time ahead for you.""  The other says  ""Soon you will be sitting on top of the world.""  Chinese cookie fortunes are my only superstition, so I  have  to believe them, right?",38
"What's an hour of your new healthy life spent divesting yourself of your old unhappy one? It's an hour well spent.  The physical manifestation of my emotional clutter goes out with tomorrow's garbage. If I'm through there's no point in keeping any of this. It's as if L wants this -- to try and have the last word. Well, the move is the end of the conversation. And what I'm spending tonight completing is the start of shutting my mouth. I tried to clean earlier tonight, and I gutted my office of old furniture and crap I didn't want to move later in the year. But my effort was incomplete. The effort I made didn't match my new life, or my true emotional state. I was hanging onto things out of habit. It all has to go. I will sleep in my own house tonight. Mine.  So I actively sought them out tonight. In drawers. In piles of mail. Dressers. None of them mean anything. I was a victim in this whole thing. The days of feeling responsible for two people's baggage are over. None of the other things are even worth my effort to put on eBay. They go out to the trash as well as soon as I post this. I'm thinking about hurling out a lot of family baggage, too. I hang onto too much. None of if reflects me anymore anyhow.  And as stupid as it sounds, I need S to know that I'm earnest about my feelings. I like her company on this adventure far too much to risk it.   And I'll tell you, after you find the first thing hiding out somewhere and toss it away you feel like a million fucking bucks. And the sleep of the righteous and freed is your reward. I learned this tonight, this late in the game. It's amazing how many things in life you assume will hurt, and feel like flying when you actually do them.",38
"Wow. WiFi in the middle of downtown Greensboro. How cool is that? As long as I pick a spot within the shadow of a building I'm not too hot, and the reception seems as if it's pretty good all over the block. I wonder if it leaks into the Cultural Center enough to make it usable while I have some crab dip and a beer @ Europa? I just have to remind myself that for the one measly hotspot we have in Greensboro, there are probably eight million in DC.   Speaking of the whole DC plan, S and I have been having the time of our lives lately. After making it through ther turmoil of the last couple of weeks, and my best attempts to subconciously fuck it all up, we are both being graciously rewarded. I can't even begin to tell you how excited I am to be taking these first few steps with someone like her. I feel as though I found a vein of serenity running through all the fast-paced goings on lately. Yes, Virginia, there is a girl who's smart, hot and hilarious. And she happens to like spending time with me.  Alright, it's getting warm out here and the car fumes are starting to make me feel woozy. But it was fun while it lasted. Off to spend an hour or two with my brother.",38
For S.,38
"Ok, so this is my new blog. Hmmm. I think this looks better over here don't you? Yes, that's nicer. Ok then.   I'd like you to go and visit my website which resides at:  urlLink Bunni's Place    It's not quite finished, because my significant other hasn't finished providing me with his significant content for his part of the site. But the rest is done, or at least done enough that it might be considered enjoyable rather than annoying. Then again some people are annoyed by almost everything enjoyable. One can't make everyone happy.   I decided that a Blog might be a nice addition as I need a place to whine without having to upload a new whiners page to my site. Not that I will always whine here, but since I have the opportunity, I suppose I could. I could also leave the page absolutely blank, and make people wonder what I was up to. Well maybe just my paranoid visitors. Most people probably wouldn't care.   There's that word probably. Chances are, you will not see that word typed on a page of mine often. Since my earliest bbs days I have cut that word down to prolly, and it's become part of my speech. I avoid saying LOL during a conversation however. I actually do laugh out loud.   Well enough of this banter, because there's prolly gonna be more to follow.   I'd love to know how you like the website, and I'd be pleased to share comments and criticism right here in an open forum if you'd like.   Thanks for reading!   bunni",39
"Oh my!   I haven't been back to post at all!  Have you been visiting my website?  It's prolly going to be moving soon as Atlantic Broadband has bought out Charter Communications.  Charter was my previous ISP.  I'm reworking the site, and making it pretty before it's time to upload it to Atlantic.  I've been busy knitting, crocheting, supporting my Fiance in all his endeavors, looking out for myself, keeping my children well-behaved and productive members of society, and feeding the cat now and then.  I'll try to be better at posting!  Hugs,  Carol",39
"I've been messing around with PSP8 again.  I'm creating some new things, and I'll post links soon enough.  My kids are gone for the week, and I hardly know what to do with myself. It's very rare that I'm left alone to my own devices.  That's about it for today.",39
"good times last night. our group attended karaoke. I planned on signing 'bad timing' by blue rodeo but they never called my name. but gosh darn was it ever a good time. beers (and when i say beers i of course mean good ole 1892 beers) were 2 for $5, quite the steal. photos taken will no doubt be incriminating.   after the pub we had a snowball fight. i was snowbanked more times than i care to remember. my whole right side is aching. tomorrow we go home. hard to believe we have been here a week already. we are just starting to get into the swing of things. just starting to build friendships and now they are going to end.  as usual, such is life.",40
"Okay, so maybe I should be a bit more clear. I am at the Canadian University Press conference in St. John's, New Foundland. You see, I am the Managing Editor of a college newspaper and I am out here representing.   Okay, let me now be even a bit more honest. I haven't been representing so much as drooling over two really hot boys. Both, of course, whom have no idea who I am or why I am. But still, good times.  There is a blizzard here. For real. No planes in or out for the next two days. I have to get out of here back to my real life. I have to go to L.A. next week and my plane leaves from Vancouver, not New Foundland.  I love you all, which really means just me as I have a zero readership at this point.",40
"I am in New Foundland. I am desperately trying to have fun and enjoy the experience. Desperately. It is taking my all but that ain't much.   anyhow, more later",40
"The absolute worst time to post is when you are intoxicated. Do you ever listen to people talk about how bad their relationships are and you think...if only I could get someone to treat me like shit.  Okay, maybe that's just me. Maybe I really and truly should be medicated. I wish I could tell you everything that happened in the last week but we aren't that close yet. I honestly do hope that we reach that level because it sure is lonely keeping all this insanity to myself.  Until then I guess....",40
"Tell me July is over.  This has been one long, painful month. One hiccup after the other. It's been a lonely month too. Good thing I have you now dear reader. I surely missed having such a captive audience. But you never write, you never call.     Sometimes I need more from you. Sometimes I would like to hear what you think. Unless you disagree with anything I say. In that case, I think it's best you stay silent.  I have to go.",40
"So, it's been awhile. What can I say...I've been busy. You know, school...work, blah blah blah.  I have been writing letters to people and then regreting it. There is something to be said about writing a letter. You feel something, you write it down, you deliver it, and then immediately regret it. The worst part about giving someone a letter is not getting any answers back. I wrote a line I was quite proud of in the last letter I gave to someone. It went something like this:  ""I'm going to walk away and cross my fingers hoping that you will have a change of heart before I forget how good the idea of us could be""  No response. Nothing. Those words were gold to me...to the other person, not so much. I even taped the letter to the front door of the recipient of the letter because I thought how romantic it would be if I came home and there was a like letter taped to my door. I use the word like because love...I mean what do any of us really know about love?  So, today I must sleep so I can function for real at work tomorrow. But I will leave you with a quote I recently heard.  ""I feel sorry for people who don't drink. They get up in the morning and that's the best they are going to feel all day""  Until next time.",40
"So tomorrow I am going to  urlLink Whistler . I am trying really hard to be excited. I am going with a girlfriend and I wish I was going with a love interest. I am in the mood to be romantic. I am NOT in the mood to get drunk and go to a bar. Man, this sucks.  I got older but for some reason some of my friends didn't. NOW, I understand how my friend used to feel. She wanted to sit in a lounge downtown, have drinks...and GASP have meaningful conversations. I just want to club, club, club. Now I am longing to sit in a lounge. I have traded in all my clubbing gear for downtown lounge chic wear. I am READY!  I mean sure I still like to shake my tail feather. Sometimes get really drunk and just go to a local club but really, what I really long for...is my friend :( I sent her an ""i love you and want you back"" email...throw a penny in a well for me, would ya.  okay, it's raining and I have a massage appointment. I'll be back tonight.  Kisses",40
"so I thought long and hard about this and have come to a very sad conclusion. i have not had sober sex in a very long time. 2 1/2 years to be exact. the only time I have had sex lately is when I have called up an old lover after a few (many) glasses of wine. this may say something very strange about me. either i have issues with sex or drinking. either way, i'm quite the catch.  but seriously, i am pushing 30 here. when does the sexual peak kick in? i am ready to go the distance. if the distance is kissing and some light petting. one day, mark my words, when i am in love and being loved back...its going to be a sex freak show. again, if sex freak show means like, i may get on top or something.  so thats whats been on my mind. what about you?",40
"So I used to watch  urlLink Days of Our Lives  but I stopped quite some time ago. I had a friend who watches it, so from time to time I have caught up with it but really things never really change on soap operas do they?  Today I saw a commercial for Days and it showed a clip of Sami and Lucas getting married. At first I was shocked. I mean after everything they have been through....why? Then I thought for one, why do I care...and for two, and this is much worse...my life may be loosely based on a soap opera.  I have it all:   Many ex-lovers who make appearances when everyone is sure they must be dead by now.   A baby from a relationship that just narrowly escaped marriage.   Evil in-laws once removed.   Friends who sleep with my current and discarded lovers.   and elusive employment.    Hmmm kinda sad actually.",40
"The last day of the long weekend. I am sad to see my days of lazing around and watching movies end but I must say that when you are alone, a long weekend feels more like an eternity.  I feel like I have been off work for weeks. And I am also regretting that on Friday I didn't get very much work done so tomorrow will seem like two days in one. Plus, I have three finals this week and I am not even sure what is going on in the classes. I really let myself get lazy this summer.  But I have decided, that August is going to be my month. When I look back in time, as we seem to always do, I am going to say be able to say ""Yes, August 2004, what a month is was."" Maybe it will be filled with intrigue and good surprises. Unlikely I know, but a girl can dream.  I have travel plans for each weekend in August. So the work week will be bookended by little relaxing getaways.  urlLink Whistler ,  urlLink Kelowna ,  urlLink Seattle ,  urlLink Victoria ...It will be fantastic.  Plus my horrible haircut is starting to find a style of it's own. I have also decided to quit smoking. I am on about 2 hours so far and it is working out just fine. I am definately going to quit smoking or really pick up the habit and be a full-time smoker. I am one of those social smokers that you all love to hate. Or maybe not.  Now if I can somehow find a way to fit in romance and wealth, this will be a time to remember. Most definately.  Song you MUST download: Lady Stardust,  urlLink Lisa Miskovsky . You can thank me later.",40

"Top 8 Reasons Working on Princess Ave. is da bomb   1.   The Fountain   - need I say more? Home of the White Trash Swim Team, and the most staggering urine to water ratio on the face of the Earth. 2.   Father Guido   and the 2-litre beer drinkers - what was once a common spectacle, but since we phoned the cops complaining, our entertainment has been on a steady decline. :( 3.   The dude   with bitch tits - now a regular character who walks down Princess with the most massive breasts I have ever witnessed on a human being. 4.   John Garcia/David Crosby   look alike - this dude is a dead ringer for the long lost Garcia/Crosby love child. Makes me think, ""if only Melissa Etheridge knew about this dead sexy man, she could have some supreme old timer rockstar sperm to impregnate her"". 5.   Hibernation Man   - the dude JohnnyO-666, KennyO-666 and I witnessed after band practice. It was like he just woke up from a glorious slumber to find that the world had changed.  Was last seen heading straight for the fountain.  DUN DUN DUNNNNNNN. 6.   One Armed Push-ups   by a dude in a wheelchair - this dude was workin' it!!! When I'm confined to a wheelchair, all I'm doing is one armed push ups. I've seen the light. 7.   Various crazies   who pick up Ken's cigarette butts - usually the same gang of Princess crazies. 8.   The dude with a ferret -   some dude had a ferret, and it needed water. So he came to ATC to give it a drink. He took the ferret back to the park to frolic. Then it tried to make a getaway, so the dude walked over to it and kicked it 3 feet in the air. Then after this display of machismo, he somehow attracted chicks like no other man on the face of the earth.",41
"Let's just say I hardly expected to be talking about religion (not matter how indirectly) on my second entry, but such is the world we live in. To set the stage, I'd like to entertain you with a little anecdote:  So the greatest guy in the world - for ambiguity's sake, let's call him ""Adrian"" - is playing Counter-Strike online one Victoria Day afternoon when a certain individual - who, for ambiguity's sake, we will call ""Priscilla"" - hiding behind the anonymity of the Internet, signs onto the server Adrian is playing in and changes his screenname to ""i fight for allah"". Adrian, being such a smart guy, corrects Priscilla, saying Allah is, in fact, spelt with a capital 'A'. To which Priscilla responds, ""allah is not my god, so i choose not to capitalize it."" Adrian is struck upside the head by this comment, and as a result, ceases to refer to himself in the third-person.  Yes, folks, believe it or not, ""Allah"" is a proper noun, and as such should be spelt with a capital 'A'. Priscilla's comment is the equivalent of saying ""George Bush isn't my president, so I'm not going to capitalize his name"" or ""I don't drive a Ford, so from now on it will be known as 'mustang'"".   Even so, the word ""Allah"" isn't specific to Islam; it's the Arabic word for ""God"". Even Arabic Christians and Jews call God ""Allah"". So, unless Priscilla does not believe in any higher being, Allah  is  technically Priscilla's god.  Ah, but what can one do? Much to my chagrin, I can't spend more than thirty seconds online without coming across this sort of garbage. As a result, I try not to talk much while playing Counter-Strike.  So what does our petulant protagonist do? He proceeds to make Priscilla eat hot lead, four rounds straight. Doesn't that make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside?  The End.",42
"Yes, this is it. Much to the delight of all connected to the Internet, if not the world, I have decided to start my very own online blog. There shall be rejoicing in the streets! Drinks are on me.  Sarcasm aside, I feel this will be an interesting experience. It's hard to pinpoint my reasons for choosing to publishing my deepest, most personal thoughts only for the world to see. The man living in my right auditory canal, but we'll leave that subject alone for the time being. No, let's focus on a couple succinct, less personal reasons:  1) Being a self-professed geek and technophile, I figure I should have some semblance of a web site, lest my PDA reject my body and eat its way through my pocket, thereby ruining a perfectly good pair of pants. In my history online, I have started exactly three personal web sites, and have finished exactly zero. Let us pray this one will live long enough to catch interest in online communities, making yours truly an Internet sensation overnight. One can dream.  2) A few of my good friends, both online and in that frightening void know as the Real World, have similar online journals. I have yet to come across a trend more worthy of my endorsement.  3) My mind is a raging sea of useless knowledge and half-finished thoughts. Hear that gurgling sound? Could just be the three-day-old leftover Kentucky Fried Chicken using my stomach as a medium to communicate with the living world, but let's not go there. Anyway, I feel I should have a place to write down some of the things that spew forth from my cerebral cortex on an hourly basis.  4) Being at the height of my teenage years, I feel it may be time to indulge in a little navel-gazing and soul-searching. Therefore, during the lifespan of this blog, I will successfully deduce no less than the answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything. You can take my word for it.  Having seen this, I'm guessing that this blog will end up being some odd combination of  urlLink Slashdot  and  The Catcher in the Rye . Nevertheless, a good time will be had by all. I hope I will be able to find the time to stop by and update regularly.  I can see that nearly an hour has passed since I started this composition. The Internet and instant messaging services are indeed powerful forces of distraction. And unwatched episodes of  24  are calling. 'Night.",42
"According to  urlLink this article , there's a Rainbow Six motion picture in the works. Of course, my first thought was, ""it's about freakin' time"".  Then I noticed that John Woo will be directing the film. I don't think I've ever gone from overdrive to reverse so quickly. John, stick to Hong Kong shoot-em-up action flicks. That's what you're good at. The Rainbow Six name is neither about slick gunplay nor fancy camera angles.   But who knows? Maybe he'll pull it off. If not, we'll have another  Mission: Impossible 2  on our hands.",42
"I'm in the process of discovering that it's  really  not easy to find time to update this blog. It seems that new posts have become a weekly occurrence. Hopefully once exams are over in a couple of weeks I'll be able to get on here more frequently. In the meantime, let's go over the past week, in insufferable detail, replete with witty idioms and colloquialisms! I'm quivering just thinking about it!   Wednesday:  Uh, Wednesday. Wednesday... Hmmmm. Must not have been an overly interesting day if I can't remember a thing about it. According to my PDA, I had a math test and the last day of my Accounting summative, but I'll be damned if I can remember. I  do  know my team managed to blow the two-goal lead we had going into the second half. End result: 2-2. No, I didn't score, but at least I didn't have to rip a loose flap of skin off my heel again. Moving on...   Thursday:  Thursday was quite an eventful day, comparatively. My mom finally dragged me across town to the licencing center to get my G1 (""learner's permit"", to all the less enlightened out there). Some forms, an eye test, and 40 multiple-choice questions later, and I can now drive! I'm free as a bird! A bird who has to fly with 0.0% blood-alcohol level, an adult with at least four-years flying experience in the passenger seat, an only between one half-hour before sunrise to one half-hour after sunset. But I digress.  It's not that I don't  want  to drive. It's just that I have no  motivation  to start. I'm not going to have my own car, or have regular access to one, and as soon as I pass my road test, I'll be relegated to the position of ""taxi driver"" for my little sister. Add $600 for driver's ed. and the early onset of grey hair thanks to having to drive with my dad, and the whole thing just didn't seem worth it. Ah, well, things are now in motion.  After working at the library from 3:30-5:30, I got  the  best exercise I've had in months. Certainly felt like it anyway. It seems the Powers That Be decided to have me referee a 14-year-old boys' game way up at Notre Dame High School in north Burlington. Of course, my dad is out of town, and my mom has to work, leaving me stuck with a bicycle as my only means of transportation to said game. Of course, the route I have to take it  uphill , into a headwind, for about 2km. Needless to say, I was puttering along on my grannie gear for most of the trip. Truth be told, though, I'm not in the best shape. On the other hand, coming home was a blast: I'm sure I hit a good 50 clicks going downhill.   Friday:  Friday, hmmmm... Friday. A lot like Wednesday. Got my math test back (aced it), did a Cisco practical exam (aced it), had to work at the soccer club from 6-9. That's just about it.   Saturday:  Six hour shifts at the soccer club are  not  fun. Especially now that the season has started and there's really nothing to do but surf the Internet, random odd job exclusive. So after working 9-3 I came home and... slept? Did homework? Played  Morrowind  for four hours? Your guess is as good as mine. This is why I need to update more often.   Sunday:  Sunday morning I got up and no one was home. It was a nice day, so I went for a walk... and bought a new  urlLink mouse . It was on sale, what can I say? This is why I shouldn't go for walks very often: I always end up buying something. I highly recommend the mouse, by the way.   Monday:  Let's run through this quickly - My Computer Engineering class managed to talk my teacher into letting us write our summative test on Wednesday instead. I say to them, why bother? You're not going to be ready then, either.  - Learned about alkenes in Chemistry. Whee!  - Hung around in Physics class longer than I had to. Double whee!  - Worked at the library 6-9  - Came home and watched the Flames lose the Stanley Cup. While studying for a Cisco exam. Right, ""studying"".   Tuesday:  That's today, so hopefully I'll be able to remember  something . Wrote my Cisco exam, and got 85%. Pretty good, considering it was on chapters 1-14, and we've only covered 1-8. During lunch I crammed for the Computer Science summative test I had to write last period. After getting out of Accounting early, I went down to the cafeteria to pick up my yearbook, sign a couple others, and participate in some rousing games of euchre. Math class consisted of more yearbooks signing. What do you expect for the second-last day of school? Anyway, the Comp. Sci. test was a breeze, so I was able to go home a bit early.  Which brings us to the here and now. Wasn't that fun?   Now, I must go suffer through another three hours at the soccer club. Ciao!",42
"With the end of school looming on the horizon, it's hard to find time to check my email these days, much less update a blog.

"In case anybody was wondering, I've been in British Columbia for the past 12 days. It seems I forgot to tell most people, as John called me on my cell phone while I was driving through Revelstoke, BC, on the way to Canmore, Alberta.    Our trip took us through Salmon Arm, BC, to Canmore, Alberta, which is very close to Banff and Banff National Park (read: mountains). Then back to Kelowna, BC, for a couple of days before returning to Vancouver and Surrey to schmooze with the relatives. I'll compose a travelogue over the next couple of days, complete with pictures (I snapped almost a full 256MB SD card full of them).    I'll leave you with a tune by the Arrogant Worms:    'Cause we've got  Rocks and trees  And trees and rocks  And rocks and trees   And trees and rocks  And rocks and trees  And trees and rocks  And rocks and trees  And trees and rocks  And water!

Perhaps I'll be back tomorrow, after a good night's sleep.   I'm off to watch the Euro 2004 final that my father conveniently taped for me.

"Ever hear the fable about the king and the invisible clothes?  Well if not:  Once upon a time (as always), there was a kingdom (ruled by a king). One day, these men come into the kingdom, saying they can fashion the most marvelous clothes, clothes that only the wise can see. Enchanted by the notion, the king immediately orders the men to fashion some clothes for him. The men set off to work, sewing and stitching what appears to be thin air. However, the king (not wanting to look stupid) ooohs and ahhhs along with the men as they explain to him the wondrous embroidery on the clothes. When they're finally finished, the king asks the men to help him put it on (as he still can't see it) and calls for a parade around the town to show off his new finery. Everyone that watches the parade only sees a naked, aging man walking down the street, but they (not wanting to look stupid) oooh and ahhh along with their neighbors as they pretend to admire the clothes. Eventually, the king passes a small boy, who exclaims flatly to his mother, ""Mom, the king's naked."" and that's when he realizes that he was scammed.  Anyways, the moral of the story is...  Those clothes are literature.",43

"Finalement , back home. Home is nice, some of the time, I suppose. It kind of sucks that you can't simply assume everyone speaks French here though.  Quebec was nice, mostly. It's simply mindblowing how annoyingly closeminded my parents can be though. They get pissed because they chose to eat at the hotel restaurant (tip: you don't eat as restaurants where there's only a single waiter) and from then on, they refuse to eat anythign but Chinese food. Add to that the fact that there aren't any decent Chinese restaurants in Quebec City and you get really pissy assholes that bitch and complain incessantly about every single meal we have.  Minus the fact that I never got to eat at one of those nice little restaurants that should serve amazing food, Quebec city was alright. They have a nice art museum, especially since the museum itself is a work of art (it  was  a prison). Oh yes, and after visiting the museum, there was that stone hamster incident, which really sucked.  You see, we had to bring along this other, unbelievably frustrating, family. Two little whiny children that cry and whine for ice cream  every single time  we pass a street vendor and whine and moan about walking before we've even crossed the street outside the hotel. And then one of the stupid little fucks wants to buy a damned  rock  painted by some local artist to look like a hamster (20$ Canadian, too... what the hell) and the bastard loses the rock somewhere in the park outside the museum. For the uneducated, the museum is in the middle of a park; the park used to be a battlefield; battlefields are usually very large.  And so, the little boy curls up into a fetal position and starts bawling his eyes out, even though his parents are still in the museum. I really don't give a shit, he can cry as much as he wants. He seems to notice no one's paying him any attention, so he stops crying for a bit. But then, his parents walk out of the museum and, as expected, he starts screeching. Someone shoot him, please.

"""Mr. Cattelan's art has provoked hands-on reactions before. When his 'Ninth Hour,' a wax effigy of Pope John Paul II felled by a meteorite, went on view at a museum in Warsaw in 2001, two men damaged the work by trying to put the figure on its feet.  The new work was sponsored by a private art foundation and produced immediate debate in Italian newspapers and, after its destruction, at the tree itself, where a seemingly permanent crowd of people gathered.  This vandalism echoed a case in Sweden early this year. While attending an opening at a museum in Stockholm in January, Zvi Mazel, Israel's ambassador to Sweden, damaged an artwork that he felt glorified Palestinian suicide bombers. The work was created by Dror Feiler, an expatriate Israeli artist living in Sweden, and his Swedish wife, Gunilla Skold Feiler. News accounts said it consisted of a large basin of red fluid on which a small boat floated with a photograph of a smiling woman, Hanadi Jaradat, a suicide bomber who killed 21 people in Haifa last Oct. 4. The ambassador's action was commended by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, who told his cabinet that he had called Mr. Mazel and told him 'that the government stands behind him on this issue.'  Impulsive destruction that is sanctioned by a nation's leaders is different from the work of an inebriated, possibly celebrity-seeking individual like Mr. de Benetetto. But both acts seem motivated by a one-dimensional reaction and a  distorted sense of entitlement that is especially surprising in the case of Mr. Mazel, a professional diplomat . Most surprising is attackers' simple refusal to entertain paradox, to see art as a coalescence of gray areas, ambiguities and multiple interpretations. Art's job is to provoke thought in ways that are difficult to resolve and uncomfortable; it's a relatively neutral place to experience the unresolvable issues that dominate real life, to practice a kind of abstract flexibility that might move us toward resolution in real life.""",43

"Everyone's been on edge a bit, maybe because prom is in such a short time; but whatever the reason, it appears that everyone's being ground into a fine powder. So when a friend made the simple comment ""You have good friends."", it occured to me that I really do. I know sometimes it seems as if I take you (a collective you) for granted, but that is only because I'm comfortable enough around you to do as much. And truly, I do love you all and I  am  thankful you're there - I'm conscious of the fact that there's generally someone I can rely on, confide in, talk to, just a short walk or telephone call away.  And I'm sorry if my humor leaves anyone bruised or reeling - I don't mean it.

"Robert and Schön Passmore took their children to Disney World last fall and left bitterly disappointed. As Christians who reject evolutionary theory, the family scoffed at the park's dinosaur attractions, which date the apatosaurus, brachiosaurus and the like to prehistoric times.  ""My kids kept recognizing flaws in the presentation,"" said Mrs. Passmore, of Jackson, Ala. ""You know — the whole `millions of years ago dinosaurs ruled the earth' thing.""  So this week, the Passmores sought out a lower-profile Florida attraction: Dinosaur Adventure Land, a creationist theme park and museum here that beckons children to ""find out the truth about dinosaurs"" with games that roll science and religion into one big funfest with the message that Genesis, not science, tells the real story of the creation.  - The New York Times  Fucking Americans.

In the century since Darwin brought forth his theory, even our closest relatives, the great apes, would be appalled by how the products of our highest civilization can behave with such savagery, and only the congenitally ignorant would argue that man has made any progress at all toward becoming a more intelligent, more compassionate animal.  - The New York Times  Well said.",43

"That's what today was. It started out as shit, but because of a lot of big and small things, it got infinitely better.  This morning sucked, frankly.

And if you don't, well I'm not at liberty to explain. All you have to know was,  that  made my day.  Oh yeah, somewhere along the way I got an award for French for something. I guess that makes a small plus to my day-counter.

"Proofread and annotated. [Annotations are in brackets.]   30 June 2004  Culture is an elusive concept. It transcends all - race, location, and numerous other barriers. It’s pervasive, yet invisible; you make it seem almost like some hidden enemy or danger, lurking everywhere and everpresent, a constant threat. But what is culture?  What is culture? The collective consciousness of a people: the value, traditions, history, and perspective of a community - in the nebulous sense of the word - and the underlying reasoning for the above. The “why” of culture is important - possibly of more value than merely the descriptors of the culture. [I have no idea how I jumped from defining culture to some crap about “why”. However, why culture exists is probably pretty significant.] It is the foundation that has determined the current state of a culture today and where it will go - or where it can go. [Cultures are not in stasis, they revolve around change, or an aversion to it. Change is never always good, nor ever always bad. But one thing it is always - it happens, and there’s little you can do to stop it.] One must realise that change is something human beings are highly adverse to and it requires an often-intimate understanding of not only the position taken by an opposing culture but the experiences which have acted in conjunction to mould those positions. Who was it that said something about it being easier to condemn than understand?  Cultures are like diamonds: they’re valuable, multi-faceted, and seemingly illuminated by an inner radiance. But neither necessarily shines in their own right - they take input and meld it - transform it - into something brilliant. But unlike diamonds, there are innumerable cultures and co-cultures - every one of us is party to countless cultures at any given time. Also, diamonds are forever; cultures are not. Everyone joins and leaves given cultures on a whim or maybe out of some requirement or need.  [A perfect example of a transient culture is Governor’s School. Sure, we’re all here by choice, but we can’t leave the culture once we’ve joined. And in retrospect, the dynamic does change greatly over time. Time here is compressed, so the changes are even more noticeable. From the first, rather awkward, day to now, when we’re all more settled-in, one can see our society being changed - and changing - its members.]  Being placed in a foreign culture is interesting. Particularly is the culture is pronouncedly different than one’s own. [But isn’t every culture very different in some aspect than one’s own?] One feels lost at best, maybe even a bit intoxicated by the assault of strange and unusual stimuli. When I was visiting China in the summer of 2000, I was placed in exactly that position. But I’m Chinese, I said; and, I speak - if nothing more - fluent Chinese! How is it possible one can speak effortlessly to the populous yet remain a total foreigner, that one needs more than just words to relate? But we do; because culture isn’t confined to merely utterances of the mouth, it is expressed in the clothes one wears, the attitude one holds, the forms of interaction that occur which go beyond speech to encompass such aspects of communication as body language. But there I was, forlorn and confined, shunned as a waiguoren - an “outsider”. It sucked, knowing that I was essentially paying my way through life with greenbacks. Traveling to Québec was fun too; and I felt more at home there than in even the most Western parts of Beijing or Hong Kong. American money is just as useful in either place.  Yes there were stumblings in my attempts at “learning the culture”, but I thoroughly enjoyed both experiences. A wise friend one said that, “Even if you stumble, you’ve still made progress. And who can argue against progress?” [And another wise saying that went something like “It is only by being torn out of that which is comfortable to you, being forced to look at your life from a distance, that you see yourself.”]   2 July 2004  There used to be a class entitled “The Theory of Knowledge” that was offered at my school. Probably they had the whole ontology-epistemology, subjective-objective-intersubjective thing going. It must have been a wondrous class though, being able to spend an hour every day discussing what is, what out to be, why it is - or ought to be, and the underlying principles of that knowledge.  What does lying count as[, in this realm of thought]? I mean, if one believes strongly enough, [some lies can be as good as the truth.] And if enough people [believe in this collective lie]?   And thus religion was born. Just kidding…  But I see how the methods through which knowledge is acquired relates to culture. What is culture? [Defining it a second time…] In the very end, it’s knowledge. That knowledge may take on physical form in the traditions of a culture, but it can also remain solely in the sphere of memory. If a culture is suppressed vehemently enough, it often recedes into the thoughts of those who cherish it, to be brought forth again when it is safe.  Language is essential to humanity. Of course it can limit us, but that is better than the alternative. [I don’t think I knew what the alternative was when I was writing this. The alternative would be a dearth of communication, a total inability for knowledge to be passed one. Sure, one can acquire knowledge, but one’s personal - firsthand - knowledge makes up only a small portion of one’s “experiences”; it is by passing on knowledge between in across generations that culture is generated.] Knowledge is transferred by way of language. And every language has the ability to enrich the human experience. Every language is the product of a people’s experiences and travails; an audible tapestry that flows and morphs with time just as its speakers do. Language is instilled with the essence of a culture, even supposedly nonsense languages carry the weight of humanity, whether in a sense of childhood when speaking Pig Latin or community in using “’net lingo”.    god, this journal isn’t going anywhere.   3 July 2004    Starting anew, and hopefully this time it’ll be more coherent. And more profound. [Profoundness is a good thing?!]  Words are not universal. That is a given. But even if they don’t all manage to convey the same meaning, [there are universals:]human experiences - at their basest level - are essentially the same. I won’t use the love example, and thus end up on very dangerous ground, but attraction, curiosity, and repulsion are essentially constants. And - to be a bit daring - “love” is just a strong attraction. Anyone who thinks that love - “true” love - is irresistible, undying, and indestructible is merely deluding themselves. So I’m deluding myself.  Imagery is also nearly universal. Even badly translated works of literature originally rich in description are still moving. Pictures, as well, are worth a thousand words. Clichés may be bad, but they’re true. A good picture conveys something beyond the realm of speech, something that reaches into the very essence of humanity, to the foundations of what it means to be human. A strong image distills language, association, and emotion into the most basic components, whatever it is that all humans have within themselves, what they use to identify what it means to be alive, and experiencing culture, and human.    I know, I’m waxing both philosophical and romantic, so I’ll stop.  Loss is another basic human emotion. Its derivative is sadness. Anger is one too. And the derivations of that: frustration, envy ,and spite.  Back to language. If Sapir and Wharf are correct, it either totally or partially dictates our perception. What about those born deaf? What do they use to dictate how they perceive the world around them, if anything?  I think that some extent the hypothesis is true, but even for those lacking hearing, there are still ways to convey meaning without language. I mean, they still form the same connections with one item and another, but they do not perceive the world in exactly the same way.  They also are deprived of the “cultural” value of language. But those are also just associations of partially-related or totally-unrelated object, entities, concepts, emotions with a given thing. “Thing” is a nice short word. And I’m out of ideas.   	7 July 2004  So we need more “good stuff”. Okay, let’s take a stab at it, shall we? With lots of analysis. Lots and lots and lots. [I know, it’s all crap. Forgive me.]  Analyse oneself. That always provides some form of production return. Let’s see… someone in class said something about “hiding something about yourself”, so that’s the logical starting place.    I’m gay.  That’s a relief; I wrote it - in pen no less - and it’s done. No, not really. Through the whole of human history (homo)sexuality has been a touchy topic. Okay, so now we analyse.  You know there isn’t much to analyse. I’m frustrated often, but far from being depressed - or suicidal. Governor’s School isn’t particularly helping either: I’m putting the entirety of a typical (or atypical) teenager’s personal issues and a pressing need for a good hug coupled with a long - long - face-to-face talk on hold for five weeks. And here isn’t really the best place - nor the most comfortable place - to work through - yes, “through” is a good preposition here [since you have to work through your problems, not around them] - my insecurities and curiosities and whatever else there is hiding somewhere in my subconscious. I want to go home.  And sure more and more people are finding out [here at Governor’s School] and I haven’t felt any enmity - distilled, diluted, or otherwise - so far but I’m in need of someplace to vent. I have no idea why it’s in my journal, but there’s no other place. I apologise; skip this paragraph if you wish. I hate being here. I’ve never met another gay guy in real life before - well, one where it was known that we both were gay, much less kissed anyone. And I’m stuck here. Stuck. Trapped. My friends finally know, and this summer was supposed to be one to remember, yet I’m fucking here, or all places. Not that I despise Governor’s School by any means, just that the “opportunity cost” of being here is high. [And economic jargon begins its inevitable integration into my speech.] And there’s almost no way in all of hell I’d let - or want - something to happen here. I hate this; I need to stop; I’m lonely and unhappy and homesick. There, I said it. I’m fucking alone in the whole fucking world, or so it seems, and it fucking sucks.    [I have my blue moments, as I’m sure everyone does. That was one of them.]    I need to call Julie for a self-esteem boost; write more later. [I love you, Julie.]  Ethnocentrism and stereotyping are both bad. How do you avoid either? “Have an open mind” is the clichéd answer. What else? Embrace everything and anything, yet do not make generalisations. Essentially I’m trying to counteract both at the same time, but it’s inevitable one will tip one way or the other. But why do stereotypes persist? To be blunt, because they’re true. Generally true. Ethnocentrism? Well, for that there’s hardly an excuse, even a callous one. So I suppose it’s better to be slightly stereotypical instead of ethnocentric. [I still hold that opinion.]  Wait; there’s an epistemological question here: why - or may “how” is better - do we - or I - know that both ethnocentrism and stereotyping are bad? Ethnocentrism effectively allows one the right to trample all over someone else’s culture - and their associated values, traditions, and ideals. And that’s a bad thing; just trust me, it is. But what about stereotyping? It demeans people, I suppose. Well I more than just “suppose” - suppositions are flippant, but you get the idea. I think that this topic is getting boring, so I motion to advance to the next one.  Diversity. Is a term thrown around excessively by, well, everyone. [What else is it?] Yes, I do think it’s nice, but you can’t that so many things of great import and compress them into a single word. [I guess I was trying to say that the word “diversity” is burdened with too many meanings, variants, facets.] Yes having a diverse group of acquaintances - not necessarily friends - can open one’s eyes, but that doesn’t work if they’re all hopelessly ignorant. But, having a more or less homogeneous group of acquaintances who are all open-minded and well-read can still confer part of the benefits reaped by living in the midst of a diverse society. Not all, mind you, but plenty. [Which is why I adore my friends. Not only are they a diverse bunch, they’re intelligent and supremely fun to be around. I love you guys.]  I think this is by far the longest entry. [My entries are not separated, unfortunately. The date divisions are just that - date divisions. In fact, one entry was written over midnight and so crosses a date division.] And my letter “a’s” are looking more and more like my “o’s”. That’s not a good thing. I’ll write more later.   8 July 2004    I feel terrible writing during a class, but if he has to repeat that concept another time I’m going to shoot myself.  So, I need lots of analysis in this journal. And some way to lengthen this by another four pages, at least. [Handwritten, on college ruled paper.]  We’ve already gone over the basic emotions, but I’m in a mood to talk more. Attraction, repulsion, and loss are good ones. Or rather, love, hate, and loss. Or rather, hate, because I’m not in a particularly warm and fuzzy mood.  Why do humans “hate” anything to begin with? Especially between cultures; conflicts often appear when cultures meet and have occurred as far back as the first civilisations. And the reasons? Misunderstanding, or even a simply refusal to understand? And with its advent, religion. Dun dun dun… Sheer ignorance or all-consuming righteousness - generally on behalf of an “advanced” Western civilization and its linked religion - usually leads to the collapse, of even the annihilation, of the “other side”. Cases in point - Africa and the Americas. Just because one feels that oneself is “better” than someone else does not mean that one has the right to impose one’s IdealsValuesReligionPerspective on someone else. And once again we hit the wall of stereotyping and ethnocentrism. [And what a common wall it is. Can we ever get beyond the wall? I doubt it.]    My thoughts were interrupted and so now I have no idea what I was going for. I’m sorry.  I’m sorry. Sorry for fucking everything. Every fucking atom in the cosmos. Because it’s all my fucking fault, that everyone hates me. People suck. They suck, plain and simple. My gaydar sucks, which only makes things infinitely more frustrating.    Don’t psychoanalyse, just read. I’m not suicidal.    And once again I forget the end to which I was heading. Fuck you all.    [Another blue moment. Don’t know where the hell that one came from, though.]   9 July 2004  I’m just going to end up writing in this every day. Well I need it: it’s a nice place to vent. Oh, and it’s rather nice to put down all my thoughts on paper.  I think I’m stuck in a rut. And a depressing rut at that. I spent well over an hour on a conference call with five friends. The content doesn’t matter, but it can be seen as a case of “intercultural communication”.  [So the five other people aren’t really friends. In fact, some probably hate each other. But they’re willing to sit there and help me hash through my insecurities and problems. And I love them for it. There was a lot more written here but it was nonsensical and dragged on forever.] Do you think different cliques in a high school each count as their own culture? Probably, especially if each group is well-insulated and things of itself as better than everyone else. Ethnocentrism? Or maybe just blinding ignorance and self-interest. But whatever the case, it happens; not to the magnitude of this hypothetical example [What hypothetical example? I think I lost my train of thought and went rambling again.], but it does happen. In some way, it’s almost like taking the world and shrinking it to a small population or a thousand or so. Not as diverse, and often much more liberal [Actually, a couple weeks of Governor’s School has proven to me there are young Bush supporters. My heart goes out to them, the poor bastards never had a chance.], than the world as a whole; but, in some creepy way, the social interactions align in pretty interesting patterns. And the student council, being - surprisingly - not just a popularity contest, is the body that arbitrates and facilitates interaction. [I think somewhere along the way it morphed from a “hypothetical” example to my school.]    I really ought to go back to listening to “international political economy”   11 July 2004    There is not way in hell this is going to be fifteen pages. And typed. I apologise profusely. [Oh, the irony.]  So I went shopping - for clothes - today. Clothes are tied in to culture, aren’t they? [And who cares if they’re not? I like clothes.] Every culture or subculture - co-culture for all the politically correct people out there - has added its own flair or input on the basic components of apparel. Especially in wealthy developed countries (i.e. the United States), one’s manner of dress does so much to project one’s identity. Or not necessarily a true identity, as one can also use clothes to mask one’s own identity. [Clothes often reinforce stereotypes.] Sure, taste is entirely a subjective thing, but within a given group it is still somewhat codified to ensure some degree of homogeneity. Because everyone wishes to belong to one or many cultures, and clothes are an easy way of doing so.  Clothes convey social status with a mere glance. They can also convey one’s interests or beliefs, although less frequently. Adamant Bush supporters don’t wear t-shirts likening Bush to a monkey just as the rich and famous don’t wear just “ordinary” clothes. Non-verbal communication at its finest.  “The meeting of cultures creates disparities in societal norms”. [Somebody said in class.] Well of course, seeing as how cultures are a composite of the values and experiences of a given group of people. And by “given group”, I assume the members of the group are relatively homogeneous, not just a random clumping of people utterly unlike each other in any way. So of course their societal norms - and extension of ethics - are not going to mesh perfectly.  “Without the correct feedback, it is human to doubt oneself.” Is it ever. I’m close to being one of the most insecure people ever, almost completely unfunctional without at least a friend beside me at all times. Pathetic, yes, but I seem to have trouble relating actual, received feedback with the outcomes I’ve already mapped in my head. And yes, I do map outcomes in my head. [I’m not sure where this came from either. Writing longhand causes weird thought patterns. Or not necessarily weird, different. And being different isn’t a bad thing, they say.]  Feedback is so crucial to a successful conversation in any medium. Beyond the fact that feedback is essentially what makes up a conversation - a verbal response, a typed response, etc. - other, more subtle, forms of feedback are also important. For example, sometimes you really don’t want to talk to a certain person. So you send subtle signs - non-verbal signs - to tell them you’re bored shitless and would appreciate it greatly if they would kindly hurl themselves off a cliff. Generally one can make the conversation as awkward as possible by trying to remain as silent as possible, both in person and on the Internet. I feel bad implying I ignore people on purpose, but whatever.    Okay, I really don’t want to write any more.   12 July 2004  [This last entry was added for no reason whatsoever. No; in retrospect it was probably added to increase the journal’s length. Feel free to ignore it.]  Communication without feedback. Feedback without communication. Neither is possible since communication is essentially the interplay of feedback in both the verbal and non-verbal components. That sentence made no sense. I was thinking of chiaroscuro, but that has nothing to do with intercultural communications. And how can you have feedback occur without the occurrence of communication? Not really possible since feedback almost always results in communication.  Gestures. You know, those really pointless actions demanded by Society. “How d’you do?” and all that bullshit. It’s all been pounded into us since the age of zero so that there are entire conversations without an iota of feeling. But that can still count as communication, given a definition of communication where the feedback does not need any form of vested interest, just an exchange of symbols. And the meaning behind the symbols is… being nice, genial, amiable.  What crap.    Okay, ta ta.   15 July 2004    So I’m writing again. I don’t know why, or about what, but I’m writing.  I had such a good topic, but I forgot it. Dammit. So I’ll write about music. Music conveys feelings. [What is that? The seventeenth time I’ve said that?] Especially wistfulness. I’ve been rather passive lately. The “shopping high” wore off, so I’m back to my lonely, carping self. And I’m listening to sappy music. Or maybe because I’ve been listening to heart-wrenching music, I’m once again back to sad-Nan.    “There are lots of fish in the sea,” Julie says. Lots and lots of fish. Write more later. I think I offended a friend tonight. [It must have been near midnight when I wrote this, because this entry spans a date marker.] A really close friend. And really badly. I feel like shit, like I need someone - or something - to talk to. I hate this, why does everyone take everything I say with such gravity? Or rather, some people take me at my word while others never think I’m being serious. [Neither is a good thing, dammit.]  I’m really fucking sorry; what else can I say? And you. You’re her boyfriend - her best friend. How can you just blow it off? How dare you just blow it off?   16 July 2004    How DARE you show no emotion whatsoever while I’m sitting here, in anguish, losing fucking sleep over it? WHAT THE HELL?!    “I; I have become, comfortably numb”, the music says. No, I haven’t. I made a careless slip and now Kaitlin hates me.  This isn’t intercultural communication, it’s basic communication. The human experience in all its wonder and evil, happiness and heart-wrenching misery; all melded together in one pitiful and insignificant life. One. Such a pathetic number in and of itself.  Does life ever become so unbearable that you - ? I suppose it can. Maybe not indefinitely, but it can. And for that one infitesmal moment, it can seem as if the tradeoff is worth it. And that’s what scares me. As if? What if it is worth it?     Shine on you crazy diamond.    What is a life worth? I don’t; maybe it’s all relative. [I believe I meant to say “I don’t know.”.] How can such a simple question not have a simple answer? [Lots of simple questions have complex answers, or no answers at all.] How can this most basic - as basic as the sun, moon, stars - of questions still require a relativist answer? Is nothing universal in its being;  is nothing sacred?  [I’m not completely sure why I associated universals with sacredness.]     And you run and you run to catch up with the sun       but it’s sinking; racing around to come up behind you again.       The sun is the same in a relative way but you’re older:       shorter of breath and one day closer to death.    	     Adieu.  I forgot to cap a brand new bottle of white-out and I put it in my bookbag. No relation whatsoever to anything, it just sucks. A lot. And this gross new formulation doesn’t come off very easily. [Or at all, seeing as how my notebooks still remain splattered with what appears to be white paint.] And it feels icky on my fingers. Why can’t they just stick with the old brush [as opposed to a new, foam one] and the old, crappy formula? Change can too be bad. Such as this case. The brush just sucks and it’s supposed to be correction fluid, not permanent paint. Oh, and it still smells terrible. So really, there wasn’t improvement. In fact, the white-out company appears to be retrogressing.  Things you believe you can’t have are as good as things you can’t have. And that sucks, [but you can’t change your mind to believe you can have something if you’ve already decided it’s unattainable, no matter how hard you try.] The mind is a truly wondrous thing [in its ability to fuck you over]; it’s almost as good as real life. Maybe better.  I think the one and only purpose in life is to find satisfaction. Or, in even more blunt terms, happiness. In some way, any way. I need some happiness in my life. What else can someone want? I suppose everyone obtains satisfaction in a different way: wealth, power, spite, altruism. But in the end, it is the same goals. Humans don’t share very much in common with each other, but this they do share. The same ones at least. [No idea where this was headed or how it got here, sorry.]   18 July 2004    I don’t know what I’m supposed to write, but I’ll write something anyways.  Mobile communication. The next big thing. Not only cell phones, or even the super cell phones that can check e-mail and send video or whatnot. But internet access from alongside every major highway and in every major city. That is the next big thing. Even now, with wireless hotspots as the newest “in” thing, people are beginning to like - and become accustomed to - the technology.  Ohh, big point. When someone becomes accustomed to something, they begin to expect it. And that’s not a good thing. Westerners are accustomed to too many things. And so they expect the world to be handed to them on a silver platter.    Dinner.    Back from dinner and ICONS. Oh, I was having so much fun, my head could explode. Positively explode.  We - as Americans - feel like we’re entitled to too much. Like it’s our fucking birthright. [Hell, the land we live on isn’t even our birthright.] But why? Is society propagating our lifestyle? Probably. Can we change it? I don’t know, can we? If we all gave up something - Hummer, golf courses, rare wood furniture - wouldn’t we all be better off? The first “we” is Americans; the second, the world. To satisfy the United Nations’ daily water requirement for all six-something billion people on this planet, it would take 2.5 billion gallons of acceptably clean water a day. The worlds’ golf courses use 2.8 billion gallons of water a day. What an epitome of the bourgeois spirit - an activity that requires an enormous expenditure of water and land seemingly to make sure that the planet would be deprived of limited resources.  How can you get across a foreign concept to someone totally and utterly opposed to your viewpoint - largely out of breeding? Indoctrination is a powerful tool. Is it possible to defeat it, however? Not from within, I don’t think. But there are no outside forces powerful enough. So is the answer no? Is there not some method one can use to get one’s point across? Even if the other party provides no feedback whatsoever, is it possible to transcend bias and prejudice - and all the collected experiences that came before - and provide sufficient reasoning for a good argument?  It’d take more than words. Words don’t have enough power. Words cannot, in themselves, convey every nuance of human emotion. The symbol component may have once held power, but the meaning has been too degraded, too diluted, too limited to hold much power anymore.    And for that I’m sorry.   21 July 2004  In global citizenship today we were talking about weblogs. I have one. This is going on it. Because at first I thought about continuing these journals beyond Governor’s School but then I realised there are more effective places to put down my thoughts. Digitsed information lasts longer than paper. Especially when something is written in water-soluble pen. [In fact, I’m destroying the original copied of my journals after I’m done with Governor’s School; this will be all that remains.]  The internet is an amazing thing. I keep a public record of my thoughts on it. It’s the most sophisticated method of communication every devised by humans. It evolves and improves constantly; it hold no allegiance to any entity; it can create and destroy lives - both real and digital; it goes beyond what anyone in Renaissance Florence could have possibly imagined; or even people at the end of World War II. It now defines a significant part of the developed world - or at least the culture and methods of communication in the developed world - and it seems likely that the internet will only grow in power and efficiency.  Instant messaging is an interesting method of communication. But not a novel idea, really. It’s like walkie talkies in words. Or really fast telegrams. Sure, it’s more cost-efficient - and more efficient period - but it’s not an enormous jump between sending e-mails to sending really short e-mails in real-time.  It gives you time to think. Much like all writing. You generally tread more carefully since non-verbal communication is absent; things can be easily misconstrued or taken literally when one doesn’t mean it. Instant messaging can also get one into a lot of bad situations - it’s too damn easy to lie or dissemble, or to be so neurotic as to believe the other party is lying. You come to realise the inflection of one’s voice makes up an enormous amount of communication.  New topic. What makes sex such an irreconcilable item between men and women? Beyond the biological factors, I mean. [Is there much beyond those, though?] The cultural factors. That men are often rewarded or commended for asserting their sexuality in a way that their dominance - supposed dominance, I should say - over women is obvious. Why does society persist in maintaining such a double-standard? Because back in “the day”, men maintained their superior position through brute strength - something that mattered quite a bit in the Stone age - and somehow have kept that position over the past however-many millennia?  Okay, that topic got boring fast. “What if you use derogatory labels but you don’t mean it?” In other words, the word “gay”. Beyond reinforcing the homophobia of society, it deeply ingrains a terrible stigma in the word, often without the user realising it. In informal polls, almost everyone that has firmly declared themselves to be open and accepting persists in using “gay” or “faggot” - and its myriad variations - as curses or insults. And then I come out to my friends and almost all use of the world ceases. Amusing, no? And now whenever someone does slip inadvertently, there’s an almost palpable cringe and awkward silence. That’s amusing.    The end.   25 July 2004  These are getting increasingly sporadic; I feel bad. But individual entries are getting longer. Hopefully it will work out in the end.  Everything works out in the end; that’s part of my theory on life. Ever the optimist, stuck in my world fabricated from wishful thoughts. People say I trust in other too much. I think I trust in them enough - such that we are all conferred the status of rational beings, and rational beings are good in the end.  I’m relaxed and content. It’s really nice. We had to “check in” again tonight, but I’m still in a mood to ponder. The past couple days have been pretty damned amazing, especially since I met someone who’d make an absolutely amazing friend. But that person lives here [Pittsburgh] and I live five hours away. So it’s true you meet awesome people here, but you may never have the chance to just sit in a coffeehouse and relax with them, which sucks. Instant messaging and phone calls really aren’t good enough; it takes someone’s physical presence sometimes. You know, those people who are entrancing in person but almost blasé otherwise. That’s a major low point right now. But you just have to push it off center stage and seat it next to the box labeled “school-assigned summer work for the 2004-2005 school year”.  Society dictates a lot of things. Is that a good or bad thing? If we were all free-thinking - and I suppose ideal - beings, then an utterly unstructured society might not be so bad. There would be no need for laws if we could all make the rational choice. But we don’t, so Society is always there to ensure we make the “right” choice.  There are decisions we make for ourselves - or that we believe we make for ourselves - and those so deeply ingrained in us that we see only one choice that would be considered “logical” to take. In fact, some decisions are so impossible to escape that we don’t realise we’re making a choice. They’re transparent and pervasive. Like culture, in fact.  We constantly make choices we’re only slightly aware of. Or ones we’re completely oblivious to. Many many times in a second. Such as why I’m not stopping this journal and heading off to mingle or why I should jump on a coffee table and start doing the Macarena. Because there’s no one to mingle with at the moment and because it’d be ridiculous and embarrassing. Why? Because Society told me it would and has taught every to look upon anyone who commits - yes, commits, like a crime - such an act as an imbecile and to point and laugh accordingly. Moreover, Society has made it perfectly clear that being pointed and laughed at is a bag thing.   27 July 2004.    Last journal entry for Governor’s School.",43
"Today I finally finished up building this wretched thing.  Last night I glued in what at the time was a perfect windshield.  After holding it down to let the glue setup, however, I noticed that I got two little spots of glue that ran down from the chrome frame that the windshield sets in; I can't keep anything nice!  In case you were wondering, in this photo the model is setting on the trunk of my fathers '57 (see photo in the last post.)  The color is called Tropical Turquoise.",44
"This is my father's 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air Two-door Sports Coupe. Under the hood is a three-year-old 350 cu. in. Chevy crate motor, pushing out 250 horsepower. Setting on top of the motor is a Holley 650 carburetor bolted to a Edelbrock intake. Bolted to the back of the motor is a Muncie 3 speed manual transmission, and the rear end is the only original thing on the car. For more information about my dad's car, I have setup a  urlLink website  where I can post photos from trips that we take in the car.  In about 10 or 12 hours I will more than likely be in the garage waxing the front of the car so that bugs won't bake into the paint job on the hood when we go to Idaho. We will be driving this car over 2,000 miles to Coeur d'Alene, Idaho for the 2004  urlLink Bowtie/ Late Great Chevy  International convention without air conditioning, what fun! Yep, that right, no air conditioning because the motor runs ""too hot"" as it is, and adding air conditioning would probably fry the thing. Get this- while driving 5 MPH in a parade our car temperature gage is halfway between C & H, however, when driving 80 MPH down the interstate in third gear the gage is leaning on H and you can smell anti-freeze. My mechanic father and I believe that the shaft in the water pump (which the fan blade is bolted to) is slipping at higher RPMs, thus pumping less anti-freeze/ water through the motor. At lower RPMs, however, the slippage is less, thus causing virtually no change in water temperature.",44
"Today, or actually yesterday, I finished a devil model car I was building.  The model is a 1953 Chevrolet Corvette Panamericana racecar, however, it ended up being a 1953 Chevy Corvette with engine parts from a 1954 Chevy Corvette because I didn't read the instructions.  OriginallyI planned to make it a model that looked like it just rolled off the line, but after screwing up the paint job in two spots on the driver's side, and numerous other mess ups, it became the ""Mexico Badger"" Panamericana racer.  I have to admit that with all the race stickers on, it does look cooler, and thanks to a couple stickers on the drivers side, I have a perfect paint job.  I plan to enter this model in a contest in Idaho next week, so I will have photos of it in competition.  If you've made it this far in the reading you are probably interested in the model cars, so here's the urlLink  link  to the kit that I built in three weeks.",44
"In case you were wondering what the hell  urlLink Internet Explorer  is, it is the computer program that you use to look at web sites on a PC. Well recently my one-year-old 2.0 GHz HP computer decided to start freezing up every time I used Internet Explorer. The thing that pissed me off was that it decided to keep freezing up while I was working on a website for my fathers classic car club ( urlLink Crown City Cruisers ), so I virtually got nothing done after working for almost two hours. Finally I remembered hearing on  urlLink G4TechTV  about an  urlLink Internet Explorer  alternative called  urlLink Mozilla Firefox . After about 10 minutes of downloading, I started up Firefox, and I haven't used Internet Explorer since.  I soon found after downloading Mozilla Firefox that you can download thousands of different extensions, which are basically little programs that customize Firefox to your preference. Browser customization is probably the feature that I love the most about Firefox- something that the communist Microsoft Corporation hates.  Mozilla Firefox is what computer geeks call Open Source, which (as Dictionary.com puts it) is a method and philosophy for software licensing and distribution designed to encourage use and improvement of software written by volunteers by ensuring that anyone can copy the source code and modify it freely. This means that if I wanted to, I could write an extension for Firefox, possibly improve the software for some users, and share it freely. Open Source is the future of computer software, and will probably one day take down large corporations like Microsoft.  If you are interested in Mozilla Firefox, or any other Mozilla products check out  urlLink http://www.mozilla.org  for more information.",44
"Well since my ""Official Website"" was basically a failure, I have decided to just create a blog and set it up so it is my website.  THX 138- What is it?  It is the California license plate number on John Milner's piss yellow 1932 Ford Coupe (Deuce Coupe) in the 1973 George Lucas classic American Graffiti.  The reason that this is the name of my blog is because I am interested in cars,  urlLink American Graffiti  is one of the best movies ever made, and I couldn't think of anything better.",44

"La Gioconda, or, the Mona Lisa. Painted by Leonardo DaVinci of the young wife of a merchant. Its painted on a thin sliver of wood, and, is admired by most all people to be considered an extraordinary painting. Her smile is unconsistent with paintings of the period, which makes it stand out. The way the folded hands make a triangle with the body is stunning.   The history of the Mona Lisa is interesting. DaVinci was asked to paint the wife of a merchant, and, it took him over four years to complete it, but, never gave it to the merchant. He took it with him to France, where it traveled from King Francis I. to the Louvre to Napoleon, then back to the Louvre. It was stolen, brought to Italy, sold, and then returned to the Louvre again. In 1956, they attempted an acid procedure on it, which damaged much of the lower half of the painting, but, was saved by many years of restoration. It now sits in the Louvre, unable to leave again.",46

"Well I was hoping today would be uneventful and boring, but my hopes were soon shattered by a little bunny.  One of my cats was chasing the little fellow around the house. He put a few teeth holes in it's little furry back. I saved the bunny from a slimy toothy doom, and now he's sitting in my old empty rat cage. The poor thing hasn't moved for atleast an hour. I can tell he's alive though. His eyes are wide open, staring down the throat of an imaginary cat.   My grandmother told me to let him out into the wild. I carried him via towel to the front lawn, but he just sat there, looking at the imaginary cat again. She insisted that I just leave him there, but I couldn't do that. I was prepared to do anything to make sure this little insignificant ball of blood and fur and organs breathe another day. I don't know why.  Alot of people save rabbits from death everyday. You'd think they were doing the rabbits a favor. The sad truth is, all living things die for a reason. That reason is called Natural Selection, or Evolution. Now, when we save a rabbit, are we doing the rabbit species a favor, or just the opposite?",46
"So, i'm an artist. Learning to be an artist, atleast. Hopefully I'll be able to practice long and hard enough to get some somewhat decent art to post. A drawing a day is my rule.  Why art, you ask? Because art is good. Art is creation. I like to create. I want to create people. People that live in worlds of my creation. People with stories of my creation. People with problems of my creations. I want to be the GOD of my own world.   Think about that for a second. If I can create with nothing but pencil and paper, couldn't the creator of me and you have done somthing similar? I'm not saying that I beleive in a god. I'm open to the idea that there may or may not be one, and that we'll probably never find out.

"Me, my brother, and my mom, were standing on the side of a road. It was the time of day where everything reflected a strong blue color. I shouted, ""This is MY world!"" In this dream I represented the color blue.  My brother seemed upset, he represented green. We argued for awhile. I can't remember the specifics. I was trying to calm him down, make him see reason. I pointed to the grass below us. ""Look, there is some green there."" I pointed across the street at a yellow Bulldozer. ""And there is a green sticker on that machine."" I pointed to a green roof on a restaurant down the street. ""And green there, too."" He said, ""Hey, I didn't notice those before."" We finally agreed.",46

"My room is an awful mess. I have a tiny desk with two monitors, covered in coke cans, a dresser I don't even use, an empty rat cage sitting in the middle of the room, ANOTHER desk covered in junk, and basically a bunch of other furniture I have no use for at all.   My mom doesn't seem to understand the concept of getting rid of junk. Our house is overflowing with furniture we do not need, and do not use, just hogging up space. Whenever I walk into someone elses home, I am simply amazed by how nice and neat and pretty things are.  Now, when I walk into my OWN home, I feel horribly claustrophobic. I wonder if my mom realises how much money she could earn by selling some of our stuff. We have a rather large pool table in our den. You can hardly play without your stick hitting the wall while trying to make a shot. Although this is hardly a problem, seeing as we never use the damn thing anyways, unless a shelf for laundry baskets really counts as using it. We also have a ping pong table, folded up on the deck, because we have no place for it to fit, and, even if we did, we wouldn't use it. I could really go on and on about all the different monstrous peices of useless furniture in my house.  So, anyways, I had a really nice idea today. There is a room next to mine, it's pretty much empty at the moment. I  decided I could connect it to my room with a door way, and make it an extension to my room. Mainly a room for rabbits and rats. I never did have adequate space in my current room to take care of rats. Rats need room to run around, you can't just keep them in their cage. I'd also move into that room my bed. Now, take this, plus a little convincing to my mom to get rid of all the other junk in my room i'm not using, and i'll be able to BREATHE again!  I've wanted to setup a little entertainment center on a single wall of my room. Nothing too big. Just a medium sized TV with some shelves around it, and maybe 2 beanbag chairs. Nothing but that on the wall. Then, on the other side of the room, in a nice open area, i'd place my computer desk. In the other room, a single bed, a 4 foot tall, 2 feet wide, rat tower/cage, a rabbit cage, and all kinds of toys for the rabbit and the rats to enjoy. Mostly just air, though, and that is what is important.   I feel i've ranted quite enough for now. I need to go talk to my mom about getting rid of all our junk now.",46

"Ok, so there is this box, and babies are flying out of it.     The babies crawl outward, each taking a different direction. One of the babies has a mohawk.     After alot of crawling, and alot of growing, the mohawk baby reaches the end of another box. Beyond it's borders is a mystery, he does not know what he is seeing.     He jumps out. Nobody really knows what happens then. Maybe some magical stuff occurs, with pretty colors, and he turns into another baby.

"It's 4:00 AM and what am I doing? Brainstorming. I had an idea a couple hours ago for the game.  Here is what I wrote down:  You play an alien trapped in the deep labrynthine walls of Area 51.  The game is a top-down grid puzzle game, much like ""Chip's Challenge"", in which you walk through a grid map, finding keys, pushing crates, pulling levers, doing whatever you can to reach the exit of the level, and make it further out of area 51.  The spin: As an alien, you are a little more advanced then Humans. You have psychic powers, which you can use to do a number of tasks, such as flipping an out of reach switch, pushing an out of reach crate, or even controlling a patrol guard, etc.  Now all I need to do is think up each of the puzzle elements, and how they will be made graphically. Not as easy as it sounds.  So, the alien uses telekenesis to solve problems, and thus we need problems to put use to these powers. This is where the real thinking begins, and my creativity is put to the test. Puzzle games are rather difficult to create, as they should be. If they aren't hard to think up, they won't be hard to solve.   And thus I sit, at 4:00 AM, and brainstorm.  Maybe some sleep will make it easier to think. G'night folks.",46

"I just got back from seeing ""The Day After Tommorow"". It's the first time in awhile that i've gone to see a movie I knew was going to be bad. It was quite awful.  On the drive home, my mom, and my brother discussed the movie. They thought it was kind of stupid too, but they only pointed out the little holes. The small little mishaps. The tiny impossibilities that you always notice in movies like this. But, they let these little holes go off easy. They still enjoyed the movie, in all of it's imperfections.  But, what about the bigger holes? The holes that real critics notice. I noticed some, if not all. For example, all of the pointless suspense added to the film, and all the sappy human-interest episodes to pretty it up and hide the unintresting aspects of the movie.  My mom and brother enjoyed the movie, they said so themselves. In fact, to quote directly from my brother, ""It wasn't that bad. It was good for what it was, an armageddon movie."" This is a prime example of a shallow persons ability to completely ignore the big picture of things, or, in this case, the big holes.",46
"[The following post has been rated ""Really Boring"", for excessive ranting about things you probably don't give a damn about. You have been warned.]  I like making games. Well, trying, atleast. I've never actually finished a game before, only started  alot of projects that were really way too extreme and large for me to actually finish them. I haven't started any new projects in quite awhile, but recently I've had a sudden urge to start it up again. This time i'll take up a strategy in my game planning.  [You don't have to read any of this, I just feel like typing it out. I'm not trying to make this post interesting in any way.l]  So, I've decided to make small pathetic games. No big epic ones. Just for now, atleast. There's something about playing you're own creation that gives you a strong feel of satisfaction in yourself, and when you work on a game for a very long time with nothing to actually play, you get bored with the project. Now, I could take a bunch of side projects, and have a big project that I work on back and forth, but I don't think that's enough. I think I should take on a big project, and instead of getting too ahead of myself in planning, I'll slowly code and create beta versions. Like,  feild with the character in all his animated glory, with all the engine stuff coded.   [Have you really made it this far? Really, you can stop reading.]  Hmm, so, like I said i've taken on alot of projects. I beleive my first big one was...no..or was it...nope. There are too many to even remember. I remember a GTA type game in which you take up missions, in a top down space shooter style, like asteroids. And a ""School Simulator"". That one was weird, yet I still think it would have been great if I finished it. Basically, you go through the school year, but what made it interesting was it was driven by a very large choice branch system, so, every choice you makes changes the rest of the game. There would be no test taking, grades would be based on your characters additude I suppose, or, possibly, when you arrive home from school you choose a certain ammount of effort to put into studying (and you'd be limited on your choices based on your characters stats) and then that would effect waking up and all that stuff. You can probably begin to see why I never finished this, or anything else I started.   Oh, and the cat RPG. That was a good one. (atleast I think so) You start the game by choosing between to cats, Smokey or Kidd. (I would post pictures but i'm not at my home computer. Maybe i'll edit the post when I get home.) The idea was that Kidd and Smokey (two rather large male cats) were fighting over who was the head cat of the neighborhood. Smokey, the house cat, would obviously start in a house. The gameplay would be as follows, you travel around the RPG style maps, finding various cats. Each cat would request a favor, or an item, or many a thing, in exchange for their alleigence. For instance, at the start of Smokey's quest you would first hafto get your furry ass out of the house. In order to do so you would hafto push some things out of the way, but the only cat with the push skill is Willow. Once finding willow, he would ask you for a favor of somesort, and upon completing whatever task was handed to you, Willow would join your party, and thus, give you access to more areas. I was going to have different areas to get into, thus having each play through of the game different then the last, by having some kind of limit on the cats you get on your team. I really favored replayability.   [Seriously, go do somthing productive.]  The only game I think I've ever really finished was ""Poke"". I kept ""poking"" people in the eye on AIM, and felt inspired to make a game, in which you ran around a box area, chasing eyeballs, and then poking them to destroy them, while at the same time running from a giant evil hand, trying to poke you, as well. I only made about 3 levels, but it was fun, and quick. I might not make games THAT simple, but still pretty simple.  I'm hungry now. I can't wait for Travis's parents to get home with seafood.",46

"I am now entirely convinced that the school system is complete, utter, bullshit.  I have this younger cousin, see? If one were to meet said cousin, within about 3 minutes of shaking his hand, one would now have a strong almost uncontrollable need to shove your foot into his face and break his nose, if you haven't done that already, that is. By being around him in strict moderation I have succesfully created an immunity to resulting in violence.   Recently I was visitng this cousin (along with many other relatives.) for the weekend. I had a good time. The fun, intelligent relatives strongly out numbered this one.  Upon stepping out of the car, my cousin was there to greet me and my brothers. He was next to the car in front of us, a friend was with him. The car radio was booming loudly with ""When I move you move! Oooh, just like that!"" playing repeatedly.( I'm sure you've heard this awful song on the radio or somthing by accident.) Him and his friend were bobbing their heads up and down, trying to look tough and cool. I sighed and wanted to run right back into the car and drive home myself, knowing what my weekend was holding in store for me.  I was glad I brought 3 books with me, because once I found a nice hiding place i'd spend most of the day sitting and reading.

"I've been gone all weekend, thus the lack of new posts, well here's something for you:  The craters of the moon looking alot like the face of a man is a very well known fact, but did you know it's really fun looking past the man, at the other things in those giant holes in the face our nightly visitor?  When my mom first pointed out the man to my brother some time ago, he saw a dragon. Only recently did I notice what he was talking about. It's kind of a deformed dragon though, with an overly large head. What was kind of odd though was I didn't see the man as I remembered him, his face was now in udder fright, instead of the friendly smile I used to see.

"So, my friend created a thread on some forums we both frequent about blogger, hoping to find some other bloggers out there that he could talk to. Then some ass-hole decides to post his lame rant about ""why blogger is crap"".  So, I decided to step in and send the guy a PM. *stands proudly in front of large blogger logo waving in slow motion.*  ""Your opinion on blogger, well, it sucks.  I happen to have a blog of my own, I don't really care for people to read it, but I do try my best to make it interesting for those who might. (http://ratnest.blogspot.com/) Yes, I do eventually post a part about myself and stuff that's been going on in my life, but only when it's important or emotional or whatever. The blog is mainly so I can practice my writing skills, and maybe have a little fun and make new friends with it.    You also seem to think that, if a person knows other people are reading their blog they won't be as free in what they write. That's true for some people, but most of those people really only have a blog so that maybe somebody out there will see their angsty unimportant troubles and feel amazingly sorry for them. They just want attention is all. I mean, I don't doubt for a second that alot of blogs out there suck. But, they aren't obligated to be interesting. In other words: Why are you bashing something that is not doing any harm to anyone?  But what really pissed me off is how you went on and on about how all journals are uninteresting to be read by other people, and then decided to say that you hope someone would read your journal someday, because, it is actually worth reading.  Online or offline, public or private, they both share their drawbacks. To be honest I wouldn't stick with a private blog/journal for more than a week.  It's  kind of like a personal confession booth. My brother reads my blog, and, without that, I wouldn't be as close to him as I am now. I'm an awfully shy person when it comes to talking in person, and especially discussing my problems with other people. Online, though, I lose most of that anxiety. Even more so when writing to my blog.   Now, don't get me wrong when I say, ""don't bash things that aren't causing any harm."" You're free to not want to create an online journal yourself, but you're going a bit too far, personally bashing us bloggers. Example: ""not as if that will stop any of 'u'.""

"I read the short story, ""Memento Mori"" yesterday. I thought i'd share a part I really liked with everyone.  "" Here's the truth: People, even regular people, are never just any one person with one set of attributes. It's not that simple. We're all at the mercy of the limbic system, clouds of electricity drifting through the brain. Every man is broken into twenty-four-hour fractions, and then again within those twenty-four hours. It's a daily pantomime, one man yielding control to the next: a backstage crowded with old hacks clamoring for their turn in the spotlight. Every week, every day. The angry man hands the baton over to the sulking man, and in turn to the sex addict, the introvert, the conversationalist. Every man is a mob, a chain gang of idiots.  This is the tragedy of life. Because for a few minutes of every day, every man becomes a genius. Moments of clarity, insight, whatever you want to call them. The clouds part, the planets get in a neat little line, and everything becomes obvious. I should quit smoking, maybe, or here's how I could make a fast million, or such and such is the key to eternal happiness. That's the miserable truth. For a few moments, the secrets of the universe are opened to us. Life is a cheap parlor trick.  But then the genius, the savant, has to hand over the controls to the next guy down the pike, most likely the guy who just wants to eat potato chips, and insight and brilliance and salvation are all entrusted to a moron or a hedonist or a narcoleptic.

Ok, I woke up to find that half my room was CHARRED! THERE WAS A FIRE WHEN I WAS ASLEEP! I jumped up put on some shoes and crawled out my window onto the roof, there were still flames coming from the top of my house, so I hadto jump. It took no smaller then 3 seconds to gain the courage, adreniline is awesome. I landed in my yard and ran as far from the collapsing pile of flaming wood. From all the excitment i didn;t notice untill now that my whole area had been hit by a chemical bomb! I suddenly heard a moaning sound from behind me, startled I turned around to be confronted with a horde of flesh eating zombies! THE CHEMICAL BOMB TURNED MY NEIGHBORHOOD INTO ZOMBIES! I whipped out my trusty shotgun and pursued my way to the street out of my neighborhood shooting zombies left and right, i had 100 feet to go and I was out of ammo! There were still zombies all around me, I chucked the gun into one, but there were still many many more. I looked around for an escape as they slowly closed in on me, then right out of nowhere a T-REX COMES AND CHOMPS THEM ALL UP! I am releived for a short second untill i realize I am face to face with a tarranasauras rex!!! AAAH! I ren into the nearest home barely escaping the sharp jaws of he beast. I know I am not safe so I seek cover in the best safe spot I can find. the SMAAAASH! The roof caves in , a giant foot scrapes the tip of my nose as I jump back in fright...OK OK...thats not what happened...  Here is what really happened... I woke up from a really wierd dream which i don't care to explain right now, I did some boring stuff on my computer, played an extremely fun and exciting game of DDR (DDR could never be boring) and ate a boring bowl of cereal. Then I went back up to my boring room, sat in my boring chair and did more boring stuff. Followed by a very boring game of sit and do nothing. Upon finishing i realized it was boring old lunch time, I ate a boring sandwich with boring chicken chees tomatos and mayonaise. My friend played 30 minutes of boring gamecube and went away to his boring home to see a boring movie with his friends, leaving me to be even more bored then I was. Then I did more boring stuff for a couple hours, then ate boring macaroni for dinner. Then I played more DDR and now all the boring stuff from earlier doesn't matter because DDR always makes me happy! ^_^  Well, Be seeing ya! posted by BuddytheRat at 8:07 PM""   That really was what most of my days consisted of a year ago. Listening to techno, sitting around being bored, obsessing a little too much over Dance Dance Revolution. Then blurrpi came along, and everything just changed so rapidly. She changed the music I listened to, got me interested in reading, and philosophy, and knowledge. Then I became sort of an elitist, without really noticing or caring at first. She told me it's hard not to, which I agree with, but I still was mad at myself for it, and then, as blurrpi always does, she gave me some advice that completely changed my way of thinking.    Blurrpi: My friend Tracy and I spend most of our time making fun of one another.  She calls me an elitist bastard. Blurrpi: It's just because I have the taste I do. Blurrpi: I mean, it started as that.  She'd say she's reading some silly teenage novel about some girl that wants to commit suicide, I'd make a face. Blurrpi: But after a while we just began goofing on one another.  She thinks I'm an elitist, even though I don't think I'm that snobby about it, simply because of my taste.  I accept that she views me as an elitist bastard, she accepts that I view her as liking trivial crap. Blurrpi: No matter what if you say you like Adaptation people will call you a pretentious elitist. Blurrpi: You can't avoid it. Blurrpi: Heh.  All you can do is have the people that you care about/care about you understand your taste, and you understand theirs, and live comfortably without hoping to change one another.  If you try to change other people because of your choices, then we have a problem. Blurrpi: But if you simply discuss and enjoy and such, don't worry.   What she said made perfect sense, but it didn't quite stick untill now, after i've read through my old blog. I was so nice to people back then. Now i'm a pretentious bastard.

I can't control my emotions, my emotions control me. Right now, I'm not sad about it. When I think back about it, it makes me kind of happy. I'm glad it happened. But at the time I hated everything with a burning passion. It's really really strange.   I wrote two versions, 'cause I was in the mood for some metaphorical writing. I need to practice, don't I? At the present moment I suck at it.",46
"I just got back from seeing Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban with my mom and Brothers #1 and #2. I'm kind of pissed at myself, because I didn't pay the slightest bit of attention to what was going on. I don't know why I was so out of it. Thinking back it was all a haze, except the big finale of the movie, which I didn't understand because of my lack of attention at the beginning. Gah, so pissed.  So, after watching who knows what, and walking out of the theatre, Brother #1 decided he wanted to take the long route through the mall so he could have some ice cream, from a place he claims makes the best ice cream ever. It tasted like any other ice cream i've ever had, except that it was expensive as hell. Before it was even handed to me it was already sort of melting. ""Too much cream and not enough ice."" I thought. I couldn't eat faster than it could melt, so by the time I was int he car it was all over my hand. I put it in a cup and gave it to brother #2. I wanted to say to Brother #1, ""Brother #1, your taste in ice cream is alot like your taste in movies."" but at the last second I changed it to, ""Your taste in ice cream sucks.""  I'm not sure why I made the last second change. Maybe because brother #2 was there? Ever since I made that post about ""The Day After Tomorrow"" i've wanted to erase it. I sound like an ass in that post, bashing my mom and my brother, calling them shallow.  Ever since I've started reading and watching more intelligent movies, i've been so proud of myself. I try way too hard to look smarter then everyone. I'm starting to hate it now. I don't want to be cruel, or, atleast I don't want to be thought of as cruel. But, i've been doing exactly what I hate.  I have this friend. She is the one who got me to start reading and watching the movies that I watch nowadays. She also got me interested in philosophy, and helped me to appreciate learning, etc. Ugh, this is hard to write down, but I hafto continue. Ok, so, this friend of mine is extremely smart. I admire her. Maybe a bit too much. Now, normally, i'd be admiring any other random girl. I'd fall in love with any girl i'd meet. Now, everyone else pales in comparison.   I don't know why I'm mentioning her, actually. I'm not mad at her or anything, or, maybe I am? I just don't know. I'm mad at myself for being an elitist asshole, that I know for sure.  I.. don't really have anything else to say. Good to get some things off my chest I s'pose.",46
"I suppose all of you would like to be updated on my Area 51 game. Well, i've still got some planning to do, but me and my co-artist guy have made some tiles and put them together to form a mock-up shot of what the game is going to look like.  We have two objects here, a crate and a barrel. The crate is pushed in 4 directions, up, down, left, and right. The barrel is only pushed in two directions, and when pushed it will roll untill something stops it. Also, when pushed into water, the barrel will float and create a platform for crossing.     That's about all we have. Exciting, eh? I'm pretty much brain dead on any other possible puzzle elements. I'm still trying to decide how buttons will work, and lots of other stuff. So, i'll keep you updated.",46
"Let's talk about brother#2. The one reading my blog. He's not as bad as brother#1, but he's pretty bad.  He used to share all the anime DVD's he got from netflix with me, untill I told him I didn't like one of the shows that he liked. He completely disbanded my anime supply.  I wouldn't spend the time to watch something because I didn't like the few first episodes, and he told me that I should give things more of a chance or something, and then *poof*, no more anime for me.   Brother#2 is still cool though, unlike brother#1 whom is the opposite of cool, maybe i'll talk about him later, most likely at a time when he's done something to piss me off (which is rather often).   I still think I worry about what people think of me. Of course I do, that's a natural feeling. I don't think there is anything wrong with that feeling though. If I don't show my ignorance, nobody will smack me on the head and tell me i'm being ignorant, and thus, I will stay ignorant.  So, thanks brother#2. You've always been there to hit me on the head when I needed it.",46
"I hate prejudice. Yet I still can't help but feel it about people. It's a natural human trait to want to feel better then other people, isn't it?   Life is so ironic, sometimes it's funny, no matter how horrible it is, but depending on your mode of thought, either you're laughing at it, or it's laughing at you. That's funny, and sad.  I'm just getting thoughts off my brain. I guess I'm being more free in what I write, even if I know my brother is reading it. I'm sick of worrying about what other people think of my blog, so i'm going to stop worrying, and start writing.",46
"I really should. And, if that's not possible, I should atleast keep them to myself.  I recently discovered that one of my brothers is reading my blog, I did give him the link and everything, but that was a long time ago when I wasn't making a fool of myself with all these latest posts. Bah. I should just change the URL, but a part of me wants him to read it.  I still stand by most of what I said in my last post, there are just a few sentences in there that I want to remove. Actually, maybe I don't. Whatever.",46
"I've wanted to write about evolution for awhile, so here I go.  Evolution's struggle, is when humanity and evolution begin to grind into eachother, slowing eachother down. As we evolve from apes, to cavemen, to the humans we are now, we suddenly reach a grinding halt.  When you try to imagine a human race much more evolved then now, a perfect race, it scares you. Everything would be equal, everything would be flat, and boring. But, we wouldn't feel boredom. We wouldn't feel anything at all. Emotions are worthless. But we love them, and can't possibly imagine being without them. Thus the grinding between evolution and tradition. Irony in it's purest form. We love to love, yet love holds us back.  Is evolution continually slowing down? Will it reach the climax of it's grinding and then suddenly sky rocket? I have no fuckin' idea. I don't know much about the topic. I am glad for the people of the future. They will cherish the flat equality of their world as we cherish the chaotic waves of our own.  I'm not going to talk about the topic anymore, because I really have no clue what in the hell i'm talking about. It sure is fun to think about though.  You know, I am starting to think that thinking, all by itself, makes a person smarter. I remember hearing that einstien used to sit in a chair for hours, staring at a wall, just thinking. Not letting other people's thoughts disturb him. (TV is a good example of that.) The mind, filled constantly with it's surroundings, never having time to actually think and act on it's own. The brain, by itself, is the key to everything.   A friend of mine and I always have this argument about escapeism. I'm into lucid dreaming, dreaming consciously. Not day dreaming, but taking control of you're actual nightly dreams. (If you don't beleive me, look at www.ld4all.com) Slowly I am starting to agree with her. It's weird, but no matter how much I disagree with her, it always seems to creep it's way into my mind and  change  me. I don't even know if it's a concious or subconsious happening, but it happens.   We're ALWAYS thinking, constantly. Sometimes it happens without us even acknowledging it. It's crazy, but our minds know the answers, and if we hear the truth, we automatically accept it. Not right away, but after awhile, we realise, because it's the truth, and our minds know it. I didn't read this, I just thought it up. I'm not bragging, i'm just backing up the fact that our minds know everything.  Or maybe they don't? I don't know. Or do I? I don't care. Do we have a limit? Can I think so much that I can't think anymore? I'll just hafto keep thinking to find out. But will I never find out? I'll probably die before than.   Maybe all the brilliant people in the world just thought more often then others? I mean, we think all the time, but, like I said, mostly we are thinking the thoughts orbiting around us, filling our minds. Visual thoughts, auditory thoughts, and so so much more. I wonder how cleary a person could think in complete darkness, with medicine to completely numb all feeling in their body? Would their thoughts just skyrocket? I want to try that. I really, seriously, want to try that. My own little experiment with thought.  God, I just don't want to stop typing, I don't want to stop thinking now. I'm trapped in the glory of thinking and learning without any external sources. But am I really learning? Like I said I don't know. Or do I? Wait, we've done this already. Is that the stopping point of my thought train? Is that where I can't think anymore? I mean, I can go back and take other tracks, but when I reach that one point I also end up asking questions, instead of stating what might be facts. I wish I could break that wall. Could I? I don't know.   How many side tracks can I take untill I run out and have nothing else but the wall? Is it infinite? Is it not? I just.. don't know. Maybe I need complete peace to find it out. My completely numb, non-visual, non-auditory, thinking mode. I'd even request that I be blindfolded, then carried to a place i've never been to, so I can't even imagine where I might be. I'd still imagine other places though, wouldn't I? It's impossible to think completely clearly, or is it? I don't think it is. I don't beleive in the impossible. I can damn well try though, can't I? I fucking will try.  It's neat how everything links up. If I think of one thing long enough, I'll could end up anywhere else. A crazy web of connections. Is there anything at all that isn't connected to anything else? Becuase of that, is it impossible to reach? Maybe it is connected, it's just blocked, by the wall I talked about. I'm just rambling now, but, I have been rambling this whole post. If I don't stop seen nobody will take the time to read this. I don't care if they do. They could always think of it themselves. They have the ability to do that. (Or do they?)   I know why I started to hate my post about ""The Day After Tomorrow"". I was being prejudice to people just like me. It's not their fault. Nothing is anybody's fault. Blame is a horrible word. A horrible horrible word. You know, now that i'm in this thinking mode of everyone being equal, i'm starting to think maybe we ARE in that flat land of the future. But maybe not. I don't know.  Maybe I do need other people's thoughts to help me along. Maybe I need to stack a shitload of books next to the wall, so I can climb upward, and once I reach the top of the wall, I'll be high enough to jump to the strange unconnected, hidden land of thoughts. I won't be able to get back though, or will I? Will I take everything from the other side of the wall with me and connect it myself?   I sure love metaphors. Maybe I use them too much? I don't know. I hafto stop. I will stop now, so you can read this. I don't hafto type everything I think. I can think after I stop typing. So NYAH!  The end..",46

"urlLink Travis  and I were digging around in my brother's old room the other day. We found alot of great things, such as my old  urlLink SNES Mouse . The little mouse that takes the place of the controller,  and is used in certain games, such as  urlLink Mario Paint .   I also found, as the title implies, a book.  Catch-22 . A friend told me a little about this book, she said it was pretty good, so I kept it and started reading it. Upon opening the book I was very surprised to see my mother's name, with the last name she had before she married my dad, drawn on the inside of the front cover in half bubble, half normal lines, like a middle or highschooler might have done. She obviously read this book a very long time ago, I'd guess sometime in highschool.  Than I reach page four, and find some underlined text. That's pretty normal. But on the opposite page, page 5, to the right of all the text is the word, "" urlLink *M*A*S*H* "" written vertically along the edge of the page, for no apperant reason. Two more pages later it re-appears. In the same place on the page as last time. But to the right of it, also vertically, it says, ""-again-"".  A little later, I noticed on the front of the book, where the numbers ""22"" are printed in rather large stylistic letters, a small imprint, left by a pen or something, lining the inside of the numbers.   I found this to be very funny. Not merely because of what is written, but because it was written by my mom when she was a kid. Intresting to think if she intended for the future holder of the book to see the notes or not. I wonder how she would react if I showed it to her.  (I tried an interesting new way of posting, by linking images or articles about various things I mention in each post. It's a little more work, but it makes it more interesting.)",46

Without it my life wouldn't be much of a life at all. I wonder how many brilliant people went unnoticed because they were unable to share their ideas to the world without any fear?   So, I just thought I'd share that.",46
"I've had/have alot of hobbies. But, i've never stuck with any of the hobbies that require any hard work, nor have I produced anything out of them. So now i'm just walking around aimlessly, complaining about it in my head, when I could be doing something about it.  I tell myself I can't do anything about it. I'm lazy and I'm going to stay that way. But I think if someone just tried to nudge me along and force me to do things I don't normally do, I'd learn to do them. My mom never disciplines me. I hate her for that. My room is extremely untidy. My mom only tells me to clean it. But, I tell myself that everyday. I don't listen to her or myself.   Although, I imagine if she did try to force me i'd be a brat about it. It's not something i'm used to, and I guess I just can't deal with it. But, if she were persistent it'd work. I know it would work.   It's kind of odd, that I know well enough that I need discipline, but I can't carry out any of that discipline on my own.  I'm positive you're sick of all these self pity posts by now. Well to hell with you. Go read someone elses blog.",46

"[Warning: The following post contains spoilers to both Spiderman 2 and the book 1984.]   Just got back from seeing Spiderman 2. I enjoyed it. And now I shall discuss it... with.. myself.   In the movie, Peter loses his powers, because he distanced himself from Mary Jane, and is on the verge of losing her completely. Later in the movie, Mary Jane is captured, and he miraculously gets his powers back. This doesn't bother me in the least. Superhero movies call for superhero logic.   Just like the last movie, the end, and the basic moral of the story I liked the most. Here we have Spiderman, fighting crime, helping the City. Here we have Peter, late for class, exhausted, losing Mary because of his web-slinging counter-part. So he quits. (Half because of his loss of powers, half because he wants what is best for Peter. He wants what is best for himself, instead of the city.) This reminds me of the end of 1984, which I finished reading recently, where Winston gives into the Party, and lets them control his mind because he stopped caring about Julia, and had nobody to love but himself. And then, the best line of the whole movie, when Mary leaves the guy she was going to marry, on the wedding day, returns to Peter's apartment, knowing that by doing this, she is putting her very life in danger, and says, ""You rescue people everyday. Now it's someone elses turn to rescue you."" or something along those lines.   Judging by the end, a 3rd intallment is definitly going to be made. So i'm looking forward to that.  So hoorah for Spiderman, and hoorah for superhero logic!",46
"I have some very random memories from a long long time ago, that I distinctly remember for no reason.  The first one that came to mind just now was sitting in Mrs. Perry's class in the 1st grade. I made a little drawing of my head, with two stick hands tearing out the hair, and above it I wrote, ""I hate school!"". Why I hated school, I do not know. I turned to the kid on my right, and showed him the little drawing. He looked very upset, and proceeded to show the teacher what I had done, and she was angry.  Another memory from the same grade. I was out on the playground, going forward and backward and forward and backward on one of those animal things on the big spring. I think this time it was a duck. I obviously had other things on my mind because everybody else had already gone back to class, and I didn't notice a thing. They sent someone out to get me after awhile.  I also distinctly remember playing by myself alot. Not all the time, just sometimes, and I would go to this cage of bars type thing, and pretend it was sometype of arena, and lizard people with swords would fight me, and I would kick their asses, and then escape. I did that alot. And then, this one time, a kid came up to me, and asked if he could play too. I couldn't imagine how it would work with more people then me, and, not to my surprise, it didn't work at all.  Another memory. The school was in my neighborhood, in easy walking distance from my house, so I walked home every day. Once I couldn't see the school anymore I would start running, scared to death, because I always thought someone was going to chase me and grab me. I was very paranoid.  So, later on in the middle of the school year I switched schools, for reasons I don't remember. I remember my first day there, and I was rather upset from the change. When all the other kids walked in I distinctly remember making fun of each of them in my mind, deciding right then and there that I would never be friends with them.  And this one time, on St. Patrick's day. While we went away for lunch or something like that, the principle and some other people took the time to create flour foot prints into our class, carefully turn all the desks on their sides, and upside down, and all disorganised, and left footprints leading out and down the hall. When we returned one of the girls in my class began to cry, because leprechauns had vandalised our beautiful classroom. So we followed the footprints, wearing our trusty green shaded leprechaun vision goggles, and found the little bastard in the office. A stuffed leprechaun doll. We then took him back to the class and stuck him in our pre-made tissue box leprechaun traps, to starve and rot and suffer in his guilt. *cough*  Not exactly the most pleasant memories. But they are fun to look back on. I was a weird little kid. I'm still a weird little kid.",46
"I made some art! (omg!) Yes. I don't normally do something like that, but lately i've been alot more confident in what I draw, despite it's crappyness. I think it's because I friend demanded that I show him my art, and after awhile of him barking at me and me cowering, I gave in, and actually realised that not everything I create is horrible. Bragging is healthy.  Ok, so anyways, the fromamouth.com 4UM's have a weekly art thing, just like eatpoo does, but with the Fromamouth.com 4UM, I don't hafto worry about being driven away by all the proffesional artist types.

"Devon used to be a fairly athletic guy, always running around, doing sports. He wasn't the best, but, he definitely wasn't the worst. But in time, he matured and became somewhat of a nerd. He was always on his computer, his brother gave it to him once he moved out and got a better one, so it wasn't a great computer. His friends, few friends, described it as 'ancient.' His life wasn't all that boring until one day...so he thought.  Devon was at his little computer, typing away for a research project for his college history class. He was writing a 10 page essay over the Revolutionary War. It was due tomorrow  and he was only on the 7th page. To make matters worse, he was really stressing out and when he looked at the clock it read: 2:16 AM.  ""Crap, why did I wait so long to do this! Prof. Neits assigned it a week ago, and I blew it off until three days before."" He sighed. He finished the sentence he was typing and leaned back in his comfy chair, his only escape from the major pressure, with his arms behind his head. The screen flashed black then a greenish blue screen popped up.   ""Oh my God! What happened to my report!!"" he screamed as he slapped the computer hoping it might help.  It flashed white then blue again and typed out the message:  ""m-th-r k-dn-pp-d. -ddr-ss = time, r-ck p-th.""  ""What is that supposed to mean? It's in some sort of code, or something...Wait a minute, there aren't any vowels! Except in time. I wonder why.."" Devon questioned. ""Hmm...maybe the dashes took place of certain vowels?? M-_-T-H-_-R..Hmmm, M-A, nah. M-E? nope...M-I!...no..M-O! M-O-T-H-E-R...Mother?! What about her!!"" He screamed, as if it were a living person.  Devon spent hours, it seemed, trying to crack the rest of the message. So far he had Mother kidnapped. Address = time rock path. He still was unsure what the time was for. Eventually, the remembered it was 2:16 when this message came up.  ""216 Rock Path? That's not an address anywhere near here."" wondered Devon. ""What addresses do I know of that have a 216 in their address..""  After about 10 minutes of thinking, he finally had it.  ""216 Rock Path stands for 216 Stoney Road! It's only a few blocks from here!"" he shouted ""But why would my mom be at the library? Oh well, I better go look for her.""  For some unknown reason, he got up, tossed his bag over his shoulder, and headed out the door.  ""What the-!"" exclaimed Devon as he peered around outside. It was daylight. ""How is this possible?! My computer said 2:16!""  He decided it didn't matter seeing as he had to get to his mother's aid. Then, he realized that his mom was here, in New York. When she lived in Kansas.  ""Wait a minute. How can she be here?"" asked Devon, as if there was some all-knowing guru right next to him. ""No time though, I must get to her.""  He trekked on and eventually reached the library. It seemed to be standing unusually taller than normal but he ignored it.  ""216 Stoney Road. This is it"" he said. As he walked into the library.   There was a spiral staircase. He walked up to it, looked upwards, only to see it going up very high. Too high He saw the ceiling and figured his mother might be there seeing as she wasn't on the first floor. He started hiking up the staircase getting nearer to the ceiling, and to his mom. He was looking up the whole time but, when he looked down, he appeared to be on the third step still. This threw his equilibruim off and he stumbled. But, the ceiling wasn't any further away than when it was a second ago. He got up and started up the stairs once again. After hours, it seemed, he finally go to the top. He peered over the edge of the floor and saw his mother tied to a chair at the end of a hallway of bookcases. He hurried up the rest of the way and dashed to his mother. As he neared her, her heard her screaming something.  ""G-- -p!!! W-k- u- D---n!!"" she screamed.  Slowly, the message became clear. She was screaming 'Get up! Wake up Devon!' Devon, realizing he was in a dream, he suddenly awoke to find himself in his room. But, it wasn't his room as it had been in the dream. Not his sheetless bed, cluttered desk and shelves. But, it was his twin bed, with dinosaur sheets and pillow, his rug with a street and town imprinted on it. The rug had toys scattered everywhere on it.  ""Devon! Get up! It's time for school!!""",46
"""LANCE! WAKE UP! NOW!!"" A large man with a deep voice was banging on the door to Lance's bedroom.  It was six o'clock in the morning, and Lance rolled over with a sigh.  He opened his eyes to look at his clock.  ""Ugh, I hate this... especially on a Monday..."" he shut his eyes and went back to sleep.    Twenty minutes later Lance's father came into the room, dressed for work in a black business suit and a tie.  ""Lance,"" he started ""It looks like I'll have to get you out of bed again."" he walked over to the side of the bed and pulled back Lance's warm covers.  Lance's legs shot up to his chest the moment the cold morning air touched him; he shivered a little.  His dad then lifted the matress off on one side, sending Lance rolling over onto the floor with a thud.  ""DAD! I told you not to do that anymore!"" he said, shooting up.  His dad replied with a small devlish smile on his face, ""maybe next time I should pour cold water on your head instead?""  Lance shouted back ""NO!  Come on dad, I'm never late for school."" ""Only because I get you up."" his dad replied.  Two minutes later they left the house, Lance was chewing on a cereal bar and trying to flatten his messy brown hair which he had no time to comb.  ""Got everything?"" his dad asked.  ""Yeah, everything except a good night's sleep."" Lance said with a small yawn.  He saw his dad get into his car and drive off to work.  Lance lived in a small community just outside of the city, so his house just across the street from school.    In Twenty minutes the first period bell rang.  Lance was practially falling asleep, he stayed up too late doing homework, only because he chatted over AIM too long.  His dad didn't get home until very late, so it's not like his dad would really care on the way home from work.  First period was Geometry, and he wondered why this class had to be first period of the day.  ""Class."" a blonde haired teacher addresed the class, ""pull out your homework.  Problems 1-65 please."" Lance's heart sank... he didn't do his homework!  ""Oh, what am I going to tell hi-"" he stopped mid-thought, walking across the room, her blonde hair flowing in the air behind her, was Alexa. She walked past the window which overlooked the flowers in front of the school, her glowing blue eyes flashed in Lance's direction, and for a moment, both eyes met, and the-  ""Looking at the beauty of God's work, Lance?"" the teacher asked. ""Uh, y-y-yes, sir.  I mean, no sir, I mean-"" Lance replied, wondered if the teacher saw him looking at Alexa. The teacher replied sarcastically ""I know how beautiful the flowers in the garden are, but please try and pay attention.  Now, you're homework?""  The last bell rang, and Lance picked up his bag and headed for his locker. Behind him walked Alexa and some of her friends.  He wondered if he'd ever get to make a move, she was always hanging around with her friends, and it's not like he could just pull up in some nice expensive car and drive away alone with her, impressing both Alexa and her friends.  He headed outside, going home, but stopped at a tree to think.  After banging his head against the tree several times, he saw Alexa come out for tennis practice.  Several rounds went by, when all of a sudden a voice popped up from behind Lance.  ""Painful, isn't it.  You're whole world standing just beyond that fence, just out of reach.""  Lance seemed not to notice too much ""it's only a fence..."" he replied back.  The guy behind him answered that, ""a very big fence, can't have stray tennis balls flying out... or flying in for that matter.""  ""No.. we wouldn't want tha-  HEY!"" Lance jumped back.  Standing behind him was a shrimpy kid with red hair and brown eyes, he was obviously a freshman.  ""What are you sneaking up on people for?""  After several minutes of talking, Lance really only found out the guys name was Mike, and he skipped all of middle school because of his intelligence, but knew how he could help Lance get Alexa.  ""Um, but if you skipped all of middle school... wouldn't that mean, you know... you're a nerd?  And uh, incapeable of getting a date?""  Mike looked stunned, ""well, if you don't want my help, you're doing a greeeeaaat job already with getting your date.  So I'll be out of your way.""  as Mike walked away, Lance realized how good off he WASN'T in getting Alexa.    The next day after school, Lance was in his position.  Mike had reset the electronic message board in front of the school to read ""ALEXA, I LOVE YOU"", and then Mike would set off some fireworks or something.  Lance could care less about fireworks, he just wanted the message to be seen.  Alexa would soon come out from tennis practice, but one of the last ones to leave so all of her friends wouldn't be there.  He waited, and waited, and waited.  Until at last, after what seemed like an hour (but was really only five minutes) Lance got up the courage to go find her himself.  He walked around the corner, only to see Alexa making out with some other guy!  How could this happen?!   Lance quickly tured around and headed home.  Moments later he heard the fireworks go off, so he suspected that Mike sent them off, and also wondered if he turned on the sign.  If Mike DID turn on the sign, it was probably in the other guy's favor.  He gave a big sigh as he fell backwards onto his bead.  ""Oh well, life moves on I guess."" he said to himself.  ""but I really did like her...""",46

"""Dimitri! Wake up!"" yelled Drew, one of Dimitri's crew buddies.  ""Huh? Aaaaaah!"" screamed Dimitri, still thinking he was falling toward the deep turquoise waters of the ocean.   ""Whoah buddy, calm down, you are safe inside the ship on a nice cot now, don't worry"" reassured Winters.   ""Ouch! Ughh...what h-happened? Where am i-I?"" mumbled Dimitri as he flinched the moment he felt a shock of pain run through his battered leg.  ""You were hanging on the anchor after being hit by that cannon ball. You fainted, but, you still hung on. You saved my life."" said Winters. Dimitri noticed the faintest trace of sympathy within his gaze. ""Thank you. And, thank God we managed to get you up. Drew here had to go down there with a rope around his waist. He carried you up to safety!""   ""Heh, th-thanks Drew. But, d-did we win the battle?"" said Dimitri, shivering from loss of blood.  ""Yes we did. It was a close one though. They got us pretty badly. I have some of the crew working on those dents below deck. It's a good thing we built her sturdy!"" chuckled Winters.  As Dimitri looked around the room from the soft cot they had lain him on, he saw Drew, Winters and a few other crew mates he sometimes talked to including Jake, Gavin, and Hector. He started to smile, knowing that all these people were here because they cared for him, just as everything started spinning and became fuzzy, he blacked out yet again.  His peaceful sleep was broken by another dream. It started just as the other one ended.   It was a trap...",46
"Dimitri hung from the anchor hole as best he could, the shock still held him in its numbing grip. He could see Cptn. Winters yelling, but the noise was shier void, as if audio has seized. Dimitri held fast for a time into the battle, but has only the strength of a man, and finally his grip faltered, and he plunged into the turquoise water.      The following few minutes were a total blur of blue and white foam, but by a godsend chance, he ended up on a plank, 100 or more yards out, it was all he could do to hold to the board as he drifted farther, and again, passed into darkness...     Again awaken, this time, to the lumbering shadow of a Royal Battle Ship. Then he noticed a life raft headed in his direction, with fully armored gaurdsmen ready to escourt him to the abyss. He made a feble attempt to flee, but it was only an aimless paddle outward, and he soon stood before the Admiral of the Royal Navy Fleet.     It was a trap...",46
"His happy thought was soon interrupted by a loud *CRACK*. Across the room, there was a large, splintered dent in the hull of the ship. He jumped, dropping Wesley to the floor. Wesley hurriedly scurried off to his same little cove in the flour, but, Dimitri had nowhere to go.  ""We are surrounded!"" said a crew member, shortly followed my another loud crack directly behind Dimitri. He was thrown forward by the sheer force of the blow to the hull. Dimitri decided to run up on deck to see what the heck was happening.  When he saw Winters standing there, calm and fierce, at the same time, he too was clam for a second. A very short second. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a huge steel ball flying through the air straight for the captain's back.  ""CAPTAIN! WATCH OUT!"" scream Dimitri as he dove to protect the captain. The ball thankfully misses Winters, but, Dimitri wasn't so lucky. The cannon ball had bashed his right leg from the knee down to no return. It's force carried Dimitri, away from the captain toward the edge of the deck. He fell down the side of the ship. The captain was sure, he would never see that young, intellegent Dimitri again.  He slowly walked to the edge of the ship to see the fate of his young hero. Everything around him seemed to go in slow motion as he peered over the edge to see young Dimitri hanging from the anchor hole.",46
"He walked carefully accross the slightly flour covered floor, taking special care of where he placed each foot. Upon reaching the wall he slid down onto the floor, his knees bent into his stomach. He surveyed the floor around him, looking for something. His face lit up at the sight of his partner. A large fat, grey haired rat, was laying, almost squished, between two bags of flour. Dimitri greeted his furry companion, and gave him a little scratch on the nose. ""Hello there, Wesley."" The rat instantly began grinding it's teeth, making the clicking noise all rats make when overjoyed.  Dimitri reached into his vest pocket, and pulled out a shimmering gold coin. The rat's eyes burst with joy at the sight of it. It began scraping away at the floor with it's paws, slowly, but surely pulling itself out of it's little cave. (How it got in there in the first place, is another mystery of the universe.) Then, like a bullet out of a rifle, Wesley the Rat came rocketing out of his hole. His head slammed into Dimitri's outstreched hand, and bounced back. Taking a second to regain his thoughts, he than grabbed the coin in his paws, gave it a snif, and than a bite. He looked up once more at Dimitri's face, to show his gratification, and scampered off, down a hole in the floor.   Wesley returned from his home in the floor, skipping greetings and immediatley searching Dimitri's hands for another shiny prize. Dimitri handed about 20 coins to the large greedy rat, untill he came back to an empty hand. Dimitri patted him on the head, and scratched him behind the ears, and said, ""Don't worry Wes, I'll bring you more another day.""  Dimitri had been practicing this ritual for quite awhile now. He's probably stored atleast 300 coins down there. Dimitri smiled to himself. He picked up Wesley and cradled him in his arms, tickling his white belly.   From above, a loud commotion broke out. Dimitri sat nervously, petting the rat to sooth his fear. He'd been through this many times, but it always worried him. The panic in his mind has calmed down a little since his first time in an attack, but never completely. To erase the fear completely would be to erase the human in him, it is impossible. The yelling got louder, Dimitri became more uneasy. He imagined the fight taking place above him. He saw the enemy ship, 4 times as large as his own. He saw a cannonball lodge itself in the side of the ship, and the entire room filling with water. He then saw Captian Winters, fighting to his very last breath, and suddenly, remarkably, most of his worry was soothed. He pictured him and Winters, fighting together, side by side. He smiled to himself again, and waited.",46
"After seeing the captain's steady gaze, he calmly went back to his room to read. He was reading a very good book. It was an action scene, much like the one he was experiencing at this very moment. The only variation was that it wasn't between two pirate vessels. It was between two small countries a ways south and east of where they were. It was a fiction book so, it never  really  happened. But, it was really interesting. So interesting, he didn't even notice the captain standing in the doorway, giving him that same, comforting, yet forceful green stare.  ""We are approaching the enemy ship."" explained Winters. ""We are just out of firing range so I need you to take cover below deck, on the starboard side.""  ""Yes sir."" said Dimitri as he snapped his book shut and stood up straight.  The captain then turned on his heel, and walked, almost marching, down below deck with Dimitri following. Once below the upper deck, Dimitri once again saw this familiar place. Barrels of ale, bags of curry and flower. There was a different arrangement in the corner with some flower bags. One could tell that Dimitri has been here before and these small battles are no new thing. Little did he know, this was not any ordinary 'small battle.'",46
"It still amazed Dimitri how organized the crew was. Drunken fools only hours before, they now worked with an ease and grace like no other. Another mystery of the universe, thought Dimitri. Perhaps though, it wasn't all that much of a mystery at all. Dimitri glanced at the captian, and they caught eachothers eyes, and for a split second, Dimitri knew exactly why the Pirates worked so well. The sharp green eyes smiled at Dimitri, and seemed to tell him, ""Everything will be alright.""",46
"""Sir! You must awaken! The pirateship Sailbeam has been spotted only half a mile out!"" Fumbiling about for his trousers and coat, the news is delivered quickly. ""The Captain requests your prescence on the bridge, sir!"" Out of the cabin, it was utter pandamonium, men hurried for their cloths and ran to their battle stations, some half nude.    Once on the bridge, he realized that only half the officers were in uniform. ""How long till were in range?"" asked Captain Winters. ""Twenty minuets, if the winds hold"", said the navigator  ""What are we up against?"", the Captain asked  ""Armorment unknown,"" said the weapons specalist,"" but our range isn't enough to strike first"" Dimitri sighed, this was the kind of thing right out of the text book, but he still worried. Would this day end for him at the bottom of the sea?",46

"In the warm lamplight Dimitri fumbled dizzily around the swaying, creaking, snoring room. Dimly lit all around him were the faces and beards of stinky old men, half asleep, half unconcious. The smell of ale wafted steadily in front of Dimitri's nose, poisoning his every breath. He carefully made his way through a maze of bodies, trying hard not to step on anyone, and then halted in the corner, shining his lamp on a large chest nested next to the wall, bolted to the floor. He exhales, sending dust in swirling patterns in front of his eyes. His attention is temporarily lost in the swirling patterns of light rays through dust. Quickly he snaps back into reality, and reaches into his pocket. His hand emerges from the pocket of his sleeveless white vest, revealing a rather large, rusty key. Hey presses the key into it's rightful hole on the chest, and turns it. Quickly but carefully he opens the large metal framed lid of the chest, and the light from his lamp is reflected back at him, from thousands of golden coins. Hastily, he shuffles a couple handfuls of coins into a small bag, closes the lid, locks the chest, and creeps back through the maze of smelly old men. He climbs up a ladder, breathes a sigh of releif, and retreats to his cabin.   The creaking of the ship continues steadily as Dimitri lay on his back, staring up at the ceiling of his private room. He closes his eyes and has a short moment of peace. Sadly to be soon interupted by tomorrow's duties.",46
"Hi, my name is Travis and my other blog is  urlLink here.   I hope that this group story blog will turn out well and I will do my best to contribute. I am not much of a writer.

"Tuesday at lunch time I received my 2 and a half month late birthday gift from my older sister who lives in Ontario. After serveral hours of attempting to install the new 7200 rpm 40 gig harddrive, i had ..er.. accidentally erased all my old data on my old hard drive, and still didnt manage to get the new one installed.  As a nasty side effect of loosing all my files, my music collection has been clipped some 200 and some odd files. 300 and some I had previously backed up to disk. Yesterday I was barely able to reinstall WinXP Pro and get back online, while I currently wait for my sister's roommate to drop me an email with instrucions on how to get the new hard drive in the right way.  My first exam starts in four days. Judging from the review the past week in class, I think I'll do farely well. Also, only 16 more days till my GameCube. Walmart is currently offering a deal where when you purchase a GameCube you receive a free 5 game demo disc; I hope this offer is available in my area. Its 12:51 (pm) here so I think I should get some sleep. I still have some more computer related setting up to do tomorrow.   This is where you stop reading.",47
"After two or so hours and a failed attempt of taking a shoutbox and some scripting savvy and making a personal blog engine, I decided it's probably best if I remain with  urlLink  Blogger   for the time being. Maybe if I get around to learning more php by the summers end I'll have another go at it, but as for right now, I can't be bothered.  After seeing it last night and it now being featured on  urlLink  Slashdot  ,  urlLink  TheOneRing.net   has a quicktime  urlLink  videoclip   of Gollum and Andy Serkis (actor who played physical gollum during filming) acceptance speech at the MTV Video Awards last night. I'm going to have to agree with slashdot on ""No joking, this is probably the funniest acceptance speech I have ever seen.""  Exams start next week and I am no whre near ready. I write math Monday, followed by science on Tuesday, English on Wednesday, and finally biology on Thursday. As an upside to all the blasted cramming I'll have to endur over the next week, I'm now glad to report I'll be receiving a GameCube for my gradding gift.   I've opted for the Wind Waker package versus the Mario Sunshine bundle. Many people were quick to judge the new look of Zelda as childish and ugly, but if Windwaker is able to live up to the quality of previous Zelda games, it will be a smash despite the new cell shadding type graphics. Enter the Matrix currently tops the list of planned games to purchase for the soon to be aquired Gamecube. I can not overly stress how much this game rocks my face.  Alright I'm done ranting.",47
"Hot. Its way too hot. At least 100, and thats celcius. Im having a hard time just sitting here without passing out, but I'll survive.  Last exam over and done with today. All together 8 pages of biology. I thought it was gonna shaft me like my science, so I took half an hour last night to go over my outline and do a little review. All and all I think I did ok, finishing up in the normal hour and a half; guess I have to wait till grading now too see how much the review really paid off.  Once again its way too hot. Enough of this drunkey monkey hoo haw.  Sitting on a cornflake.",47
"Alright harddrive update. Thanks graciously to the very skilled people in #windows95 on DALnet, I was able to sort out my problems and have my new 40gig drive up and running as a slave drive. I would have liked to get it as master and move my files over to it, using my old 8gig for music stoarge, but one thing at a time.  I just finshed writing my English exams just over 40 minutes ago, I think I actually did well. Considering how much I choked on my science on tuesday, I hope to woo my parents with a uplifted enlish mark to help secure my Game Cube.   Speaking of which, only 10 more days till I get it. I've been doing some handiwork here and there lately, so I'm happy to have nearly enough money to buy the Matrix Reloaded when I do get the Game Cube. First things first though, Windwaker has to be beaten. And for that to happen i'll be needing a memory card so I guess I'll have to dip into my matrix money. Not to mention my girlfriend's prom next week, so theres another slice of the pie gone. Oh well hopefully I'll have it all sorted out by July. Dam these western sandwiches are good.   Anyway back to mp3 whoring, so far 40 of my 200 deleted songs are back... oh the joys of 56k.  I stop typing. You stop reading.",47
"Oh bother, I just remembered something; I forgot to announce to the masses that I completed Wind Waker. Well not so much as completed, as I did finish the main quest. Kudos to sreid for navigating the last stretch before I took a break from packing to deliver the end blow.   The finishing cinematics are really something, much better then Orcarina of Time or Manjora's Mask, and the fact that you start a new quest after first beating the game. Nothing amazingly new in the second quest, mostly just change of clothing for characters, start of with the delux pictograph, and you gain the ability to read Hylian, but a nice little addon none the less. So all thats left now is the collection of side quest items, heart pieces and whatnot, and it will be another Zelda game behind me. I shant think I'll grow as bored with this one quite as quickly I did the others, the game is simply to large.  One peeve however is seems to lack the number of enjoyable minigames that were tucked in with previous Zelda versions. Wind Waker does feature serveral games in it, but none as addictive as ones in Orcarina of Time and the dark world shooting gallery in Link to the Past. What the game lacks in mini games it more then makes up for in side quests to keep the player content and involved with the game, which is always nice to see.  Now as Wind Waker fades into memory a new choice is presented: Enter the Matrix... yes or no. A month ago I would have clubbed myself like a baby seal if I would have considered no as an option, but after rewatching the Metriod Prime movie clips on the bonus disc, and checking out other games now out for the GameCube, I'm starting to question if I really feel like completeing a game with the style and size of Enter the Matrix. By the end of this week I'll have enough money to purchase it, so I supose the descision will be made then.  Thats about it I supose; as it will be a very boring and uneventful night as most of the chatters have gone to the grad party. *sigh* whats a poor nerd to do? Eat, yes eat. Left over pizza... exelent. Oh I managed to catch the end of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles the movie last night, it brought back some very fond childhood memories.  Cowabunga. Hahaha, I made a funny!",47
"Hmm blogger got a new layout while I was gone, nice. Anyway, back after 3 days, and my headache is finally leaving so its all good. My little trip rocked the perverbial face.   First, prom. Nothing exciting to mention there, as most of the grads headed off to my cousins early to the party, leaving myself and my girlfriend, along with about 10 other stranglers behind. The party after the prom, that was good. Not gonna blurb about details that noone will read anyway, but I did wake up after 2 hours of sleep to find myself in a very cold and hard bottomed tent. The liquid refreshments from the night before made up for the pains the next day.  Today I had the pleasure of a pounding headache following me around, but a sinutab on the drive back home is finally putting that dog to sleep. All thats left now is a 8am wake up for grading day. Ugh, not looking forward to that. Not because of the grades, but because for some stupid reason they plopped grading day on a saturday this year. All I can say is: what. the. shit.  Nuts to your blinces, I'm going to bed.",47
"Ooo, look at me! I'm Mr. Happy Man, I like to make people happy! And I live on a gum drop house on loly-pop laaaane!  No, not really. Actually im exhausted; 8 hours of Wind Waker will do that to a person. I swear the thing has a center of pure heroin wrapped in a delicious chocolate coating. Its addictive and I need help. Please, for the love of god save me from my wonderful new toy. Oh well, a fool and his gamecube are soon parted, and rightfully so. A three day break from the magical black box tomorrow for my cousins graduation and some visiting, then back home friday night for grading day marks the next day. Enough about me though, hows things with you? Dog still alive? Kids still not getting the fuck of your lawn? Yeah I know, same ol same ol.  ...but what aboot second breakfast?",47
"Whoa buddy, lets settle it down there scholars. No, no lets not.  Friday night I had to work, just moving and setting up sound equipment. No big deal but I didnt get home till 4 in the morning so I'm still exhausted, 4 and a half hours sleep tends to do that to you, but money is money, and I'm glad I had it. I say had because yesterday I got a pleasent little surprise when I got my gamecube a week early. Unfortunatly the save card and players guide for Wind Waker came to 52 bucks, so my money left me as quickly as it came.  Now for my official game review deal.  Anything bad said about the graphic style of Zelda Wind Waker can go burn itself. The new cell shaded style the producer implemented fits perfectly for the game, in addition to the sound, which is also phenominal. Im not even a forth of the way through the mian quest and I can tell already the development team really went all out for detail and game immersion. The environments are massive, and completly interactive while the AI is far more diverse then previous games. Another improvement is player control, adding the ability to crouch and crawl, along with ""sidle"" along narow ledges. Swordplay is also more advanced, more varying attack combinations make for more energetic fight scenes.  I could go on but there is so much more ot the game then I feel like typing out. I highly recomend everyone with a gamecube to go out and buy this game. Those without gamecubes should buy one just for the fact of getting this game. This game gets my personal best of 10 thumbs up, along with super fantastico rocking my face award.  ...Seek... help.",47
"Maybe inspiration wasnt as hard to find as I previously thought. So this is the new layout, I might tweak some alignment here and there, but I'm pretty happy with the look as a whole now. I orginally planned some over lapping images, but I changed my mind and realized the whole process of uploading images to a free host and stuff would have been just a hassel. So yeah, how about those pirates.  Well thats basically all I had to blog. My main rant I already did for today, so unless I end up doing something worth mention, or get bored again, I guess this is it.  Fuck fuck, mother mother fuck.",47
"I mean whos dick do I have to suck to get some explosions around here. I'll correct myself right now about the previously mentioned ""Blogs of Interest"" as they are actually titled ""Blogs of Note"". Grammatical error or not, I still hate the idea of them like a fat kid hates celery.  Now living in a time where even Joe Shmoe can post his ideas and thoughts to the world via such resources as the internet, I think the idea of raising a few such blogs into the spotlight to be shown as more important or more relivant then others is remarkably stupid. Who are a few such clones to deem that one persons life be more wrothy then an others, or claim that since one blogger says something a little differently, covers things a little diffently, or lives life a little differently, that it is a amazing development.  And maybe I'm wrong, maybe I myself am over-emphasizing, but the fact remains that there is nothing more special about one blog then another. Well, besides this one, but thats heartless spam of course. Just felt like getting it off my chest. Maybe if I can get some traffic and actually post some content that the masses deem entertaining I'll gain the goody goody gosh status of being on the front page with 8 other ""Blog of Note"". But for that I might actually have to do the layout I've been seeking inspiration over.  Jesus people suck.",47
"Didn't blog lately, because frankly, nothin happened. sreid got his NBA Street Volume 2 which inheirently rocks our faces, and we've been trying to school each other in that the past few days. Breagh came over today, so I've been in a pretty good mood since.  Me and sreid decided to walk to town today and see what was good at the theatres. We made it in there in about an hour and a half, which we thought was a pretty good time. Bought tickets to see The Hulk but then changed our minds and opted for Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. It was a good action movie all and all. Lots of explosions, hot chick, all the good stuff. The only downside was certain plot twists where you really had to understand the first two movies or have been following along intentivly to really understand it.   Anyway that was cool and I got home round ten to twelve and decided to browse a little before I get some much needed sleep, lord knows I need it after the walk to the movies. Fuck fuck mother mother fuck its warm in here, another nights above the blankets I supose. It is summer but I hate when I end up kicking the sheets off halfway through the night only to be woken up an hour later when the temperature drops and try and remake my bed while in it.   Incase you didn't notice (which the few of you who read the blog probably did't), I added a hit counter at the top of the page to keep track of how many people I've actually managed to woo to my site. I just stuck it up there for now until I do a remake of the blog layout and find a better spot to put it. In the meantime be sure to spam out http://debian.blogspot.com to all your little friends.  > *sniff* *sniff* > DEFENCE! HOO HOO! DENFENCE!",47
"Canada Day! Bah, who really cares. Me and sreid played some 007 and went to Don Cherries for his birthday supper; the steak there was delicious. After coming home and reading about 50 different blogs I decided to really put some personal content up on the site and hopefully get more people interested in reading it more frequently.  Right now however it's 1:38am and I don't have the slightest of energy to start redoing a blog template. Not to mention I have to be up to mow grass tomorrow and spend no doubt several hours infront of the GameCube playing sreid's yet to be aquired NBA Street Volume 2. For the moment I'll be content if I can get some pepsi and about 10 hours sleep.  > The winking pirate. > Weeooo! Weeooo! We got paint! > I hid the other 3 in the mushroom soup.",47
"One of the better Mondays I've had in quite a while. The morning was spent idling somewhat bordishly (if that IS even a word) on the net, then after lunch me and sreid headed to his house to burn some music. A few hours later my music collection goes from 450 to almost 1100 songs now. Oh but shhh, dont let the RIAA find out. While burning he and I set about completing more of his recently aquired Mario Sunshine for his new GameCube, and when burning completed we opted for a trip to subway where I selfishly delved into my Matrix money to keep my stomach content. We tried renting NBA Street Volume from the video store, but aparently there was a lock on his name, so we eventually ended in town and him getting 007 Agent Under Fire for his grading gift, or was his birthday gift, I dont know.  The game plays well and there are plenty of options to customize gameplay. We only played the multiplayer mode, but I expect the missions to be weel constructed too. I was glad to see the presence of AI bots in multiplayer mode, it really helps boost game value when you want to play a little skrimich but dont want to have to rely on a second human player for an opponent. I'll cut my review short there as I'm in the mood for a rant, bare with me.  If any of you little people out there reading this are also bloggers, and have browsed the random blog list on the main page of blogger.com, you have no doubt seen the Blogs Of Interest blogs listed there. Now correct me if I'm wrong, but when I see a list of blogs titled ""Blogs Of Interest"", one would come to the reasonable conclusion that these blogs would be interesting; they would be different, they would be something that I could enjoy to read each time they're updated. They lie! Now I'm not saying my blog should be put on this list, I'm not jealous or any close proximity by any sence, but I see nothing extra special about the serveral blogs I have looked over in the list. Call me a ass for thinking so, but I really think whoever decided these blogs were special, has some creativity issues.  Now I dont know if there is supose to be any certain honor amongst bloggers or what have you, but I feel like I have the right assigned to me by the wonderful freedom of speech to lay a royal smackdown on Matrix Essays in particular. I myself am a huge fan of the matrix, seen the movies, quote the lines regularly, bend spoons and dodge bullets on occation, but this blog, is uber poopoo. Thats right, Ive had to lower myself to the level of calling things ""uber poopoo"" to describe this blog. I've thought about the ideas the matrix represents, the messages it can convey under the actual screenplay, and the intellectual stimulus it can provide if really thought out, but this site takes it way too far. Explaining unforseen events by reasonable doubt is fine, but I think people who take the Matrix and bend it into the bloody bible of their life is truely pathetic in my views.  I didnt see anyone taking a copy of Ace Ventura and study it trying to derive connections to every possible segment of religion, humanity, and social issues. I know the movies have little to no similiarities, but thats what they still remain to be, movies. The matrix is a freaking movie, not some blasted 8th wonder of the world. It doesnt hold the meaning of life, a prophacy of things to come, or the Carmilk secret. Its a entertainment medium, end of story. Stop trying to pick it apart and guess what each and every frame of the movie conveys, and enjoy it for what it is, a well writen and well directed peice of flim.

"Not a bad bit of HTML if I do say so myself. Yup I finally gathered enough energy to complete a whole new layout. The layout itself is baised off an already made template at  urlLink http://www.1greeneye.net/ , however the one you see before you was hand coded, and my bets are if you look at their source code, its a hell of alot cleaner. But I mean, hey its a lazy Sunday night, so what else is there to do for those of us with no life. Thats right, twiddle our thumbs and hum hillbilly tunes to our keyboard.  Alright I could have sworn I mentioned in my last blog that I was going to the beach today, but I guess not. So I caught a little sand and surf. Well actually I caught alot of sun, and now the burn on my back prooves it. I'll be a nice brown by tomorrow, but I ended heading for the water before I roasted the front side of me, so I guess I'll be tan on one side, albino on the other. Dam sunbruns sure do make you thirsty.  Still no decission on Enter the Matrix yet, but I'm leaning towards it right now. I just wanna figure out if the two disks are for seperate missions or just one long continuous gameplay. I'm hoping each disk represents a character. Ive played as the man, but I want to see how or if Niobe is any different. I've seen the previews so I know you get to play as her on atleast on mission, but the possibility of two different story lines you could follow is just a hope I dont want to let go of.   Driving in my big blue truck.",47
"I neglected to blog yesterday, so I figure I might as well do it now.  Last night me and sreid walked to and from the movies. It took about a hour and 15 both ways, and I wasnt really tired from it I'm happy so say. We seen The Hulk, right now my opinion of it is pretty iffy. It was long, which was good, but too much of it seemed like useless story line trying to explain things. Despite bad reviews due to CG, the hulk himself seemed very natural. The action sequences in the movie were well done and I'm glad to say the acting wasn't as terrible as I thought it might be.  Breagh came over today, it was a great time, after some stuff the las tfew days the visit really helped things. Right now I'm getting ready to fetch another snack, and watching some movie with Jennifer Anniston. Dam shes mint. Anyway enough of this.  My raisin russian queen. And me, the super evil genious. Muwah, dam those fat kids.",47
"Alright so I opted for sleep over editing the layout, like it matters.  I can't feel my arms; alright; I can barely feel my arms, my neighbour's lawn mower is too freaking heavy. Its like pushing around a wheel-barrow full of fat kids, and we all know how dam heavy fat kids tend to be. But I'm glad to say I'm 20 dollars richer for having done it, money which could be going towards a new game seings as how I now have around 70 some odd dollars. However since I am planning on a little trip next week I think the game shall have to wait, for how long I don't know.  And that's my cue to exit. I'll probably be blogging again when I get home tonight, for those of you who care. There are people who care right? Right?  Mommy?",47
"So yeah, more mods to be made on the layout, but definatly not another night up till 2 in the morning doing so. Blogger seems to be hopping back and forth putting new blogs in the blogs of note section; why don't they just make up there mind.  Anyways it seemed like a very short day today. Got up at 12:30, had breakfast, net, ect. Went down sreid's and played some NBA Street Volume 2 for a while, then came back here and did the same. Right now I'm more then a little bored and enjoying some very ""educational"" television. Oh well, I guess I'll edit the layout.  Now listen meow.",47

"Pretty spiffy if I do say so. Another layout done and I think it looks good. I'll redo and add my bio to the whitespace on the right later on, right now I'm happy just to look at my finished work.  Oh and until I add it to the links collum, you should click  urlLink here . This has to be one of my all time favorite sites concerning people and things getting flamed. Maddox, you rookass.",47
"I'm back from my break. Actually I was back this afternoon but couldn't be bothered to blog. It was a good little trip all in all. Spent Monday evening at Breagh's; then Tuesday and Wednesday we hung out at the Marina with the peoples and her her house come the later hours.  I was planning to be home by tomorrow morning but Breagh was going to the mall today so I figured I might as well join her and get dropped off at the ol homestead on her way back. She got some clothes and things and we browsed the stores for a while then had some Burger King for lunch. She wasn't feeling to great so she stopped in at my place for a bit and had some Advil and rest. Now shes back home and I miss her already.  .  I got another layout coming along. I'm thinking I should begin saving my old ones to offer as templates. Which reminds me. I was offered a position as a html coder at  urlLink http://www.inxstudios.com  before I left the other day. Its a new site featuring graphic design and webpage development it seems. I met the creator of the site a while back, he saw my site layouts lately and was interested in me coding templates to be sold, so I guess I'll be doing that soon enough.  Tenacious D is good. Really really good. You should download pirated music of their recordings. I like short sentences. Hell. O.  Down. Syndrome. :(",47
"Haven't blogged in hmm, 6 days is it? Why? You know why, nothing has happened, obviously. I can't even recall any worthwhile events the last 6 days to use as filler... dam. Oh, Breagh came over yesterday, its all good. Other than that its been a pretty anti-social week, however I did wander out this evening to whoop sreid in a game of pool volleyball, go me ;D.   I hate those messenger spam messages. I'll offer several lines of glory and praise to the one who brings me the head of the fucktard who thought that Windows built in spam option was a good idea.

"well i have found a solution to the problem of integrating a biography or about section of myself onto my website; move  the personal stuff to blogger. hence i have divided #! /bin/debian into two distinct sections.   the first of which is here; by back from the dead blogger account which i have not actively used since last summer. this will give me a chance to post the more blog-ish type events which i feel like talking about, as well as being a page more devoted to myself as oppose to my other interests. think of this site as just one big about page section for my site.  the other half of #! /bin/debian would be the site currently residing on  urlLink http://debian.recile.net , which will serve as a somewhat e/n webpage to my multiple nerd interests, as well as any tidbits i feel like posting. it will cover the more public and external portions of my site, while this, the blogger, will cover the internal.  i still have work to do to the debian.recile.net site to remove sections of my bio and whatnot and redirect about links to this domain, as well as make a semi-official post like this one to give people the 411 on the existance of my blog.  hopefully this seperation of personal from public irected content will help me devlope debian.recile.net more while still providing me with a station for blogging which i orginally wanted. in the beginning all i wanted was a single personal webpage; but trying to mix content about myself as well as content relating to what im interested in wasnt as easy as i planned, and its so much more simpler to have individual sites for it now.  anyway i better get dressed or something. breaghs coming over later to visit; so i guess she gets to finally meet my sister. see how that turns out.",47
omfg  .. MORE LIKE DOUCHE-FIRE.. ahhhh THERMODYNAMCILA,47
"Wah, man finally off the phone after like nearly 10 phone calls to ISPs + PSTN companies. Just got my local home phone changed to B… cos man it’s DAMN cheap… yep, I reckon it is… cos it’s only $29.95 for line rental, (which is cheaper than ANY OPTUS or TELSTRA LINE! – both above $33) and not only is it $29.95… it includes 100 local phone calls!!! – we only make like around 70 or 80 per month so we never have to pay more than $29.95. much cheaper than what we pay which we used to pay (which was $33 for line rental no free calls, and then pay like up to $15 just for local calls, and then we make like an extra $15, for Mobile + STD, for international we make a local call and use a calling card which is even cheaper…)  SO! - $29.95 and that’s all why? – cos I changed ISP to iiNet. Cost only $79.95 per month, but I get $10 off, per month cos I also joined their iiPhone, which means I only pay $69.95 for like 32gb download, which I seriously doubt I’ll ever have to worry about going over, if I don’t plan to download crap loads of stuff. And it’s a 512/128 connection 32gb, for less than $70… then iiPhone, there are no monthly fees or anything, it just for mobile, international and STD calls, (we’ll never use the international calls) but as for the STD and mobile calls, they have the cheapest rates out of all the providers I have ever seen, SO that means we’ll lover that $15 to mobiles to maybe 10… so if I add up everything that’s only $100 per month for all phone and internet! – which is a much better Deal than our current $160 per month deal… so yeah, all is good =) save parents $60 per month. And we’ll get to use the phone more and not pay as much.  Okay… not that you needed to know all that crap! – but man that took me ages… 1 ½ hours to get done… and well 328 words to type what I did =S. I spent like some time yesterday night to check out mobile plans, and then ended up with home phone plans, and I also came across the net plan SO I just got everything changed the next day. No rash decision, all figured out, been thinking about the net thing for ages.  Mobile plans… why was I checking them out? – well, supposedly my family’s gonna have a ABN number… meaning I can sign up for business plans… and the thing is business mobile plans have the CHEAPEST imaginable rates… so yeah, it’ll be good, only down side of things is that they don’t offer Yes time… which I guess right now isn’t such a  BIG deal, cos I’ll just get people to call me, But then again, I don’t use Yes time THAT often so with what I save if I wanted to phone someone even without yes time it would be worth while. BUT my contract only ends like next year… and well I plan to by a new phone in SG or Malaysia end of year… so yeahz. I’ll see what happens… still got heaps of time.   (man what is this guy talking about yeah??? – weirdest blog entry ever right? – hmmm maybe… )  Anyway! How was my day? – Good, cos I feel better =) but still not perfect, I actually was running late for the train on the way home, cos I wanted to go somewhere before home, so I jogged a bit, and got my heart rate maybe up 10 bpm, and well I could feel that even if I wanted to run 100m tomorrow, there was no chance I would make it to the finish line ALIVE! If I tired… cos I think it was like the virus that could attack the heart, and well I could already feel that it wasn’t good. BUT if I didn’t run, I think today, was the best I’ve felt in like 2 weeks.  Spesh first period, man been awhile since I’ve had spesh… I’m so far behind, David Oh, the ultimate genius of Maths… is like Kenny… you’ve done nearly nothing this year… no exercises no home work… if you tired Kenny you would do so much better, (well I guess who would yeah?). in some sense to me that’s a huge encouragement, cos the fact is, right now I’m doing spesh unlike anyone else, but yet, man I’m KICKING like 80% of the people at BHHS!!! Now that is HILLARIOUS! – I feel like one of those people who everyone hates… never do any work… but still can do so well =P hahahz! YES! – man how good does that feel, but yeah I think in the long term, esp when everyone revises at the end of the year, I’m sure to fall behind.  Okay, Maths was my BEST subject by far when I was younger… I ACED maths up to year 9 =S then well, hmmm people got better than me, and I just got used to it. So now I don’t care =S Cos it’s DAVID OH, man how can you beat someone who get perfect mark, even if you tired, you can only equal him, and what the guy don’t even do half the set work… but me =S I do maybe a tenth =S probably less... hmmm I guess what I’m trying to say is that I’m still no over this mental battle to figure out whether I’m dumb, or that I have a brain. (not literally). It’s not good to admit you have one, and well that’s what I’ve refused to do for many years already, making myself believe I’m dumb, so it’s okay to not do well, (my excuse), but then hmmm if I tired, I guess I could do better, and currently, if I tired I don’t know what the possibilities could me. Maybe I could do really well at spesh? Which is kinda important… sighz, I don’t know, maybe I’m scared that if I try and I don’t do that well that I feel that I’m stupid, cos well without trying I’m doing =S alright, but it’s not something to commend… cos it’s pretty dodgy, since it’s no where near an A+… just cos everyone fails… I guess I can’t compare to them… well not can’t I shouldn’t. I should have higher standards… but yeah, doesn’t it feel good to feel that you kicked people’s bums?...  Hmmm, what I seriously wonder about is all the people who are like thinking… what? Kenny kick people’s bums, and he didn’t even do anything… BHHS must be full of the biggest retards… Well that’s where you’re wrong, BHHS got tons of smart people, the school overall does A LOT better than average, and well is one of the schools with the highest percentage of people who get about 90 as an ENTER.  Okay, I’m just gonna shut up now… I just need to study and do spesh for once… but in my head I keep thinking, if I don’t try, I can’t be blamed for getting a crap mark.  Ha… man I write so much crap that, because of this, I’ve decided to open a new blog, and stick all this crap into there… I need to maintain a decently level of quality of saneness in my proper blog.  Well I’ll just end this crappy post which will be my first post in my doggy blog! =) baiz",48
"OK, in retrospect, the song should be called ""Plutocracy in the USA,"" since plutocracy is rule by the wealthy, whereas oligarchy means ""government by the few, esp.  for corrupt and selfish purposes.""

"Searching for ""Kapitalist"" online, I thought I'd find many bands with that name, but apparently there are more named Chaotika.  However, we might need a rule about any name that already has a dance club with its own handbag:     Then again, the name ""Kapitalist Handbag"" has some song title potential.  Do you think the Beatles, or Metallica, or  urlLink Beatallica  came up with song titles first, then lyrics, then music?    Found an interesting trend searching for ""Kapitalist Handbag"" which lead me to  urlLink ""Capitalist Handbag"" .  Seeing only 1,560 search results on google, I thought pluralising ""handbag"" would bring the search down to more  urlLink Google Whacking  potential.  However, the search for  urlLink ""Capitalist Handbags""  led to 31,100 results.  This confirms the fact that capitalists like things in plural, because they can afford more handbags.  I am going to have to admit right now that I am more musical than lyrical.  Without knowing what process Hetfield/Hammett or Lennon/McCartney used, I think of the music first, or at the same time.

"Lessee. . . . I'm currently slowly working my way through the 700-page Pushcart Prize anthology from last year - it's an annual compilation of the best stuff printed by small presses (fiction, non-fiction, and poetry).  Well worth the time; some of it is crud, but there's a lot of good stuff, as well as some pretentious ""I'm in a writer's workshop and so surely everyone wants to read about my sexual frustrations"" sorts of pieces.  Overall quality level is very high, though, and pretension quotient is very low.  I'm also starting Matt Rohrer's new book of poetry (whose name escapes me right now) - Matt is a good friend of mine from high school and was the best man in our wedding.  I tried reading ""I, Claudius"" by Robert Graves (a fictionalized ""autobiography"" of the stuttering Roman emperor)  earlier in the summer, but sort of got bogged down.  I think that may be more of a depth-of-winter project rather than a lazy-hazy-crazy-days-of-summer project.  Lisa and I are still working our way through an out-loud--before-bedtime-reading of ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.""  Finally, I'm working my way through Eric Schlosser's (who also wrote ""Fast Food Nation"",  which I highly recommend) ""Reefer Madness"", which explores the underground economy - illegal migrant farmworkers, the drug trade, and I can't remember what else.

I know that there were murmurings of having him be on this blog, and I'm sure he'd appreciate the invite, and also emails.  His address is be21314(at)alltel.net   Sorry for my lack of activity here.  Been doing... other stuff... yeah.  You can prolly get more details on my blog.  -- RawkStah",49
"THERE'S NO ACTION..    Fine, you lazy bastards.  Don't participate.  I won't either..  Here's an easier one..So they're having a competition to suggest the   urlLink most beautiful German word.    Personally, I think of German as a utilitarian language, and not all that beautiful.  But, I appreciate the way they tie lots of smaller words together to mean something complicated.  For instance, there is probably a word in German that means 'go online to order a laserjet toner cartridge,' that sounds something like 'Gotgittinundtcartrichvonlaserinkeinonlein.'  So I'm looking for nominations for the most beautiful English words.  Here are some of my suggestions:  -coffeepot -lackluster -somersault -winnow -slippery -perspiration -spinnerbait  -m",49

"The abuse of Iraqi prisoners in Iraq is disgusting, abhorant and near vomit inducing. American and British soldiers, albeit a minority of them have behaved terribly and individually they should be punished, but at the very top heads must role for these despicable war crimes.  The Red Cross has reported severe concerns of breeches in POW conditions as stated under the Geneva convention, and yes all ye idiots, America has signed up to the Geneva convention. In the British segment Red Cross advice was acted upon, the fact that the abuse ever took place is appaling by itself, but in the American segments abuse continued.  The Arab world will use this again against the west and in particular America, a major figure must go to show that these acts of abuse are simply not tolerated, for the good of all of us. RUMSFIELD MUST RESIGN.",50
"Exam stress, a stubborn attitude and a slight arrogance on my part have made the last week difficult to say the least. I have been, in the words of one of my 'friends' (you'll see why I use inverted commas later) a jumped up backstabbing dick. I think this email, sent to me after a pathetic dispute over... well the email explains all:   Dear Richard   You may be correct, it may be us that owe you an apology, and i am sure that we were all prepared to talk about this like sensible adults. However, you may think that you are being mature by sending around an email telling us that we are pathetic, but for once could you maybe take a step back from your seemingly bottomless pit of knowledge, and the attitude that you always know best, and think to yourself ""Maybe i am the pathetic one?""   For example how did this whole situation spawn, well i can tell you quite easily, it began when we very kindly invited you to come on our holiday with us in the forthcoming summer, what a nice gesture. Obviously not. Somehow you managed to fabricate the idea in your own mind that we didn't want you there, which we obviously didn't considering that we invited you! You then went on to moan about the cost, location, and company which would also rather piss you off somewhat if anyone else had gone about acting in the same 'pathetic' manner. When asked if you would be attending the trip by myself and Richard you went on to kick a chair, slam a door and then go and tell Adam and Simon that they wern't invited. Very mature. I feel that what you did to them was the biggest backstabbing action which you could have taken, very noble considering that you were supposedly good friends with all of the people on the trip. As you can tell this pissed all of us off just that little bit more, but still i was prepared to hear your side of the story so i came and found you in your history room where YOU found it interesting to bombard Amy and myself with abuse, yet again another honorable action.   Then i attended Science today happy in the knowledge that i would see my good friends Richard and Polly. However, as you may know the mood turned rather sour when you found my very funny joke somewhat unfunny and went about hitting me in the face.(Which i must add was a pathetic punch)   I feel that the trouble with you Richard is that you are somewhat insecure about yourself, your exact words were ""I'm not really bothered by what you are saying, it means nothing to me"" if you not bloody bothered then why hit me in the face you idiot if your not bothered then why get in such a shit about everything, why do you make everything worse for yourself squaring up to my best friend storming off in a rage, we are not trying to upset you, it is called a joke if you wern't so pathetic and took it all with a pinch of salt people wouldn't know that it got to you, so wouldn't drill the same old insult, personally your poncy little spack today just made the joke twice as funny, as did it for everybody else in the square after you walked off, hopeing to leave in some sort of dramatic fashion when actually all you did was make yourself look like a complete twat. You wonder why people call you boring, or moody it seems inconceivable to me that you can't see why, this time last week i still thought that you were a genuine decent bloke but you just went and made yourself look like a complete idiot by trying to make somesort of noble stand, resulting, as per usual in everybody else laughing behind your back.   Richard C was right from the very beginning when he told me that you could be a jumped up backstabbing dick, i gave you the benefit of the doubt, but you had to go and shove a number of friendships right up your own ass. Pathetic.   Written by Nik   agreed by Richard    The joke he is refering to by the way, is writing nazi on a photograph of me and drawing a swastika.  I do have to admit he has exagerated these facts ever so slightly, yet it remains me who is the one who needs to apoligise. Considering my actions of the past few days, weeks even, I can see and I do realise that I have behaved in a manner that isn't appropriate, isn't friendly and a manner I simply should not have behaved in. I have apoligised to these people, but I doubt my apoligies will mean much.   I need to consider to myself, what do I want to get from this life? Happiness of course, and if this is what I want, why I am going about it like this, clearly the wrong way. Why am i ruining friendships that took an age to build, with people I actually do get on with, despite thier frequent need for racist comments. I have decided the best strategy by far is too keep my head down until way after exams now, but I'm not sure they'll have the same idea. It seems to me that I have taken a feeling of self belief too far and stepped in the realm of feeling some kind or arrogant self importance.  Things need to change, and they need to change now, I can only hope that I can change myself before I lose even more friends.",50
"Perhaps a slight exageration, but tomorrow is my last GCSE exam! This momentus event in my life so far will be a 2 hour history exam on the subject of Germany between the wars, now you don't get any more exciting than that.  So this is the end of my secondery education, the end of an era you might say. After this point I shall be moving on into the world, tomorrow marks a conerstone in my life.  Okay, so now I've written a lot of waffling nonsense about that lets see whats been going on today. Um, not a lot, football tonight has been funny, final games of group C in Euro 2004. Italy played Bulgaria and Sweden played Denmark. Before the game it was widely publicised that both Sweden and Denmark would progress to the next round if thier game ended in a score draw of higher than 2 - 2. This was of course followed by the famous Azzuri excuse machine going into overdrive, ""it will be a conspiracy"" they shouted, ""we worry they might fix it"" vieri was quoted as saying. So guess what the final score was? Yep 2 - 2, never have I laughed so hard at a football result. So Sweden top the group, Denmark come second and Italy and Bulgaria are going out. This match certainly wasn't a stitch-up, but it is a very, very funny result. If Jonsson hadn't scored that late equaliser for Sweden, Italy would have been spared.  Alas, tomorrow night is a much more important game for myself, it awaits to be seen whether Germany can actaully become good at football suddenly to beat the Chezch Republic. I shall be out celebrating the end of exams with my phone constantly buzzing with score updates.  Which brings me on to the proposed events of tomorrow night. A piss up in a field. Yes, thats right, we shall be going out and doing the most stereotypical of teenage taboos, we shall be going to a field in the evening with some beers and some cider and getting sloshed. Oh the joys.  For now, I must flee, for there is much last minute, panic revision to be done.",50
"urlLink Germany 0 latvia 0 , not a great game at all.   As promised I shall explain my reasons for my disent towards Ukip. Ukip are a party controlled by a idiot, spun by an American and whose lead candidate in the European elections is a bigoted racist with a permanent sun tan.      To move on from the childish reasons, the Independent on June 16th put it nicely, describing just what leaving the EU means, it  urlLink truly is a £23Bn question . Not only is it sheer lunancy to leave the EU, the largest free trade area in the world and the greatest single benifit to UK interests, the alternatives proposed by Ukip are terrifying to say the least.  They want Britain to leave the European Union, but they are in favour of economic globalisation, and a stronger role for the US dominated World Trade organisation (WTO). The WTO which is already forcing genetically modified US goods into British supermarkets; the WTO that puts global free trade before environmental regulation; the WTO that undermines national laws to push its own economic rules on nation states. While Ukip say they are concerned about independence from Brussels paradoxically they are perfectly prepared to surrender our sovereignty to the WTO and the US.  Similarly Ukip dangle before the electorate the enticing possibility of joining the North American Free Trade Association (NAFTA) to replace the EU, cementing Britain’s place as the 51st state of America. Unfortunately however this would allow American companies to be free to sue British companies for loss of profits if they tried to impose health and safety or environmental laws that according to NAFTA’s frankly bizarre definition of free trade discriminates against these companies.  Rather more worryingly, Ukip have almost identical policies to the BNP on migration and asylum; many UKIP parliamentary candidates have been former National Front or Northern League of New Britain Party activists, hence UKIP have been dubbed ""the BNP with smiling faces.” I only have to point your attention to Robert Kilroy-Silk, who made horrifically stereotypical comments about Arabs describing them all as “suicide bombers, limb amputators and women repressors.”  Ukip is an unrealistic political party composed almost entirely of white middle-aged men who seem determined to try and return Britain to an imagined 1950s golden age. It's not going to happen, Britain is stong when in Europe, strong when at the heart of Europe, strong when she can speak alongside her European allies to provide a counter-balance to the lunatic US foreign policy of late.  Recently after Ukip's supposed election breakthrough (15% of the votes from an uninformed and uninterested electorate), they have vowed to 'wreck' the European parliament, so they don't just want to 'wreck' the UK by withdrawing it, they want to ruin the institution that is bringing economic, social and political benifits to the rest of the EU. Selfish? Go and play your mindless political games elseware Mr Kilroy-Silk and let the people of the EU enjoy the peace and prosperity that a stable and united Europe has brought to us.",50
"Exams are all but over now (I have food technology and History left but they really arn't important), so the long summer has all but begun. This can only mean one thing, time for a lot of drunken parties, lounging around doing nothing in particular and eventually and very reluctently accpeting that I shall have to get a job once I begin to run out of money.  As I write this its half time in the Germany vs. Latvia match in Euro 2004, I expect I'm one of very few people in England cheering on Germany, often in a match like this the whole nation become honourary supporters of the opposition. The English have always disliked the Germans and as far as I can see always will, no doubt there are very deep physchological reasons for this none of which I can be bothered to venture into now.  Throughout the country theres a lot of rather messy upheaval regarding Europe and Britains place in the EU, something I feel quite strongly about as a person who considers himself to be 'European' rather than 'British' (this is because one of my grandparents is Irish the other German) and I feel particuarly strong ties to both these countries. I'm personally disgusted by the gains of the far right UK independence party at the European parliament elections last week for reasons I shall venture into after the second half of the football.  Caio for now.",50
